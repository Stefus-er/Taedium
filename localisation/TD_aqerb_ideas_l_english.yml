Not only is this aesthetically pleasing, but also leads to deeper knowledge about the universe."

Now, thanks to years of building and maintaining advanced irrigation systems, cities like Barqanah can prosper withouth direct connection to a water source."
 AQERB_palace_strongholds:0 "Palace Strongholds"
 AQERB_palace_strongholds_desc:0 "Our beautiful peninsula wasn't always a good place to live. Many wars, internal conflicts, invaders from the sea and now from the east have caused widespread devastation in rural areas. With this palaces became obsolete, and elites, wanting to still show off their wealth, started building castles in easily defendable positions, which are characteristic for their elaborate structures and rich decorations."
 AQERB_family_bonds:0 "Family Bonds"
 AQERB_family_bonds_desc:0 "What is more important than family? According to aqerbic, only the true God.

This helps to keep the power within the elite, as they are both the rulers and advisors."
