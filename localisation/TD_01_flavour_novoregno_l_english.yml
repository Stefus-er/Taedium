 novoregno.1.desc:0 "Ali Ibn Sumayya Agellid Al-Altaqadim, also known simply as Agellart, has recently become a very popular poet and philosopher amongst the lower nobility, mostly composed of native yaltazimi believers. He has a unique point of view on conflict between yermic and saelian faiths - his mother was a devout sigilian woman, but his father was promoting in him traditional Aqerbic values. In his youth his researched led him to a suprising conclusion - what if Saelius, the first Saelian Emperor, was actually one of the yaltazimi prophets? He bases his claims on the monotheistic nature, inspiration from ancient muzbahi political models and influence of Aqerbic merchants in Saelius' early life. Despite being a very radical idea, it's quickly spreading amongst the nobles and burghers, seen as a common ground to unite both religions."
