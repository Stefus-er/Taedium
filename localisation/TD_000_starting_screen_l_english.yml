 mysentria_desc_SS: "The continent of §YMysentria§! went through a lot in the past few decades. Wars, losing contact with the east and - most importantly - the §YGreat Plague§! which greatly reduced the population of the continent. Ever since then Mysentria has been slowly rebuilding and the turmoil has allowed new nations to rise from the ashes of old. \n\nAt the end of XIV century the §YBunelisuli Horde§! destroyed the remnants of the §YZakarturi Empire§! and continued their raids and plundering westwards to Confinia. Their efforts were only stopped in §Y1432§! during §Ythe battle of Matliman§! in which the Bunelisuli and Anavatic forces were slaughtered by the §YEneratian§! forces of §YChilverchians§! and §YPamkuseans§!. Death of the Great Khan proved to be enough for his empire to collapse into dozens of splinter states across the steppe. \n\nPopulous nobility of the Chilverchian states after the Bunelisuli collapse quickly started to search for a new source of glory. They turned their attention towards §YSigilians§! living in the west, who were much weaker due to the recent second wave of the plague. There they established new states, but their aggression wasn't without a response - in the north §Ythe kingdom of Donuçakar§! began fortifying its border and in the south §Ythe Capiranellan League§! became much more militaristic in nature than originally intended. \n\nIn the west, the old king §YEnrique II de Verracia§! is continuing his campaigns against the §YYaltazim§! heathens. By granting the new lands, known as §YMarca Acerba§!, to his nobles he wishes to keep their ambitions in check and their loyalty unbroken, however the future of the kingdom after his death is uncertain. \n\nIn the north, §Ythe 2nd Ehren Federation§! is pushing neighboring countries under their political and economic influence. Young and recently elected §YDiedrich Schumacher§! doesn't want to stop at peaceful diplomacy. §YNiftlandian§! states must prepare for the inevitable war with a much stronger neighbor. \n\nLying in the heart of Mysentria, §Ythe Saelian Empire§! continues to stagnate. §YHeinrich IV§!, despite inheriting fertile lands of the duchy of Lichter, continues to give out his wealth to the various imperial princes and §Ythe Tetrarchy§!, which is seeking to increase their power at the cost of the Emperor. Despite all of this, ambitious §YAlbrecht von Shlaufberg§! will soon bid for the throne of the Empire with a dream of true unity and peace. \n\nOn the §Y11th of November§! in the year of our lord Anno Imperii 1444, the king of Nevledi, §YSigimund Wiklin§! died and in his will he demanded for his domain to be inherited by the Bogilish dynasty Laski, which is considered the turning point in not only Mysentrian, but world history."

 capiranella_league_SS: "The Capiranellan League"
 CAP_desc_SS: "Capiranellan League is a diplomatic entity formed by desperate states of the eastern Camaria - Capira, Mazzardia, Tiarene, Acciarerto and Orenade. The league's goal is simple - to protect against the Chilverchian marches and ultimately defeat them and return status quo to the region. This, however, might not be the easiest task - internal instability caused by each nation's desire to gain something from the alliance threatens the integrity of the pact. The league is doomed to fall - inaction will let eneratians win and Camarian victory will defeat purpose of the league. Or is there a way to save it and bring a real Camarian unity?"

 NRB_desc_SS: "In the recent times, the Kingdom of Narbona has been experiencing an age prosperity thanks to the reign of Enrique II de Verracia, known as 'the Conqueror'. He rose to the throne after defeating both of his older brothers in the civil war following the death of King Alfonso V. \nHe placated the nobility by promising new lands westwards - territories controlled by Tepanates of Altaharan, Ridyahan and Zironaqpa. This led to the series of wars in which Enrique managed to double the size of his kingdom. The problem was - the land he obtained had to be given to his nobles, because of earlier contracts. Thus 3 duchies were created - Padosi, Breatecia, Olegaria and Qaranish. The ambitious king doesn't want to stop his conquests and threat of war against the remnants of Ridyahan and the Algshabaldani Alliance is increasing each day. \nAqerbic states hope that after the death of this bloodlusted king they will be able to regain their ancestral home. Will they succeed? Will Narbona dominate over the peninsula? Or maybe a new power will emerge, created by increasingly rebellious dukes? "

 ARG_desc_SS: "King Osmund I was not the greatest king - he managed to lose land not only to the Sointuva invaders, but also to those treacherous Ehrens. After his (too long) reign ended in 1442, the kingdom was split between his 2 sons - Sexbald and Osmund. Both of those men claim to be the true rulers of the dragon throne, but most of other nations refer to them by their ducal title - duchy of Ethelnothdun and duchy of Anginneowu. As of 1444, the conflict between these two mostly devolved to insignificant skirmishes and raids. Despite this, both of them have been arming themselves and waiting for an opportunity to strike - will Argenia finally reunite?"

 WED_desc_SS: "Wedlan people have always had a strong sense of national identity. They developed their state and converted to Sigilianism independently from Bogiland thanks to Ostemer merchants often trading with the local natives for coniferous wood and amber. After some time, they became oversea merchants on their own by expanding their influecne in Marstonia. This is the time the city of Hercogaosta was founded to spread Saelian believes and smoothen the trade with Aligeris. Recently, the island of Lara came under Wedlan protection after the local ruler drowned in debt. This made the WGH - Wedlanka Gildija Handlowa - to increase its presence in the Mezonian strait by becoming a guild in the city of Zirgukalnis to the dissatisfaction of the Mezonian rulers. Will Wedla be able to dominate over the Ostsee?"
