#continents
 mysentria_desc_SS: "The continent of §YMysentria§! went through a lot in the past few decades. Wars, losing contact with the east and - most importantly - the §YGreat Plague§! which greatly reduced the population of the continent. Ever since then Mysentria has been slowly rebuilding and the turmoil has allowed new nations to rise from the ashes of old. \n\nAt the end of XIV century the §YBunelisuli Horde§! destroyed the remnants of the §YZakarturi Empire§! and continued their raids and plundering westwards to Confinia. Their efforts were only stopped in §Y1432§! during §Ythe battle of Matliman§! in which the Bunelisuli and Anavatic forces were slaughtered by the §YEneratian§! forces of §YChilverchians§! and §YPamkuseans§!. Death of the Great Khan proved to be enough for his empire to collapse into dozens of splinter states across the steppe. \n\nPopulous nobility of the Chilverchian states after the Bunelisuli collapse quickly started to search for a new source of glory. They turned their attention towards §YSigilians§! living in the west, who were much weaker due to the recent second wave of the plague. There they established new states, but their aggression wasn't without a response - in the north §Ythe kingdom of Donuçakar§! began fortifying its border and in the south §Ythe Capiranellan League§! became much more militaristic in nature than originally intended. \n\nIn the west, the old king §YEnrique II de Verracia§! is continuing his campaigns against the §YYaltazim§! heathens. By granting the new lands, known as §YMarca Acerba§!, to his nobles he wishes to keep their ambitions in check and their loyalty unbroken, however the future of the kingdom after his death is uncertain. \n\nIn the north, §Ythe second Ehren Federation§! is pushing neighboring countries under their political and economic influence. Young and recently elected §YDiedrich Schumacher§! doesn't want to stop at peaceful diplomacy. §YNiftlandian§! states must prepare for the inevitable war with a much stronger neighbor. \n\nIn the heart of Mysentria lies continuously stagnating §YSaelian Empire§!. §YHeinrich IV§!, despite inheriting fertile lands of the duchy of Lichter, continues to give out his wealth to the various imperial princes and §Ythe Tetrarchy§!, which is seeking to increase their power at the cost of the Emperor. Despite all of this, ambitious §YAlbrecht von Shlaufberg§! will soon bid for the throne of the Empire with a dream of true unity and peace. \n\nOn the §Yeleventh of November§! in the year of our lord Anno Imperii 1444, the king of Nevledi, §YSigimund Wiklin§!. died and in his will he demanded for his domain to be inherited by the Bogilish dynasty §YLaski§!, which is considered the turning point in not only Mysentrian, but world history, being a first stepping stone to the formation of nation-states, the reformation and ultimately fall of the Saelian Empire."

 capiranella_league_SS: "The Capiranellan League"
 CAP_desc_SS: "§YCapiranellan League§! was formed by desperate states of the eastern Camaria - Capira, Mazzardia, Tiarene, Acciarerto and Orenade. The league's goal is simple - to protect against the §YChilverchian marches§! and ultimately defeat them and return status quo to the region. This, however, might not be the easiest task - §Yinternal instability§! caused by each nation's desire to gain something from the alliance threatens the integrity of the pact. The league is almost certainly doomed to fall - inaction will let §Ythe Eneratians§! win and Camarian victory will defeat purpose of the league. Or maybe there is a way to save it and bring much needed unity to Capira?\n\n[Root.StartScreenUpLeftDesc_bottom]"

 NRB_desc_SS: "In the recent times, the Kingdom of Narbona has been experiencing an age prosperity thanks to the reign of Enrique II de Verracia, known as 'the Conqueror'. He rose to the throne after defeating both of his older brothers in the civil war following the death of King Alfonso V.\n\nHe placated the nobility by promising new lands westwards - territories controlled by Tepanates of Altaharan, Ridyahan and Zironaqpa. This led to the series of wars in which Enrique managed to double the size of his kingdom. The problem was - the land he obtained had to be given to his nobles, because of earlier contracts. Thus 3 duchies were created - Padosi, Breatecia, Olegaria and Qaranish. The ambitious king doesn't want to stop his conquests and threat of war against the remnants of Ridyahan and the Algshabaldani Alliance is increasing each day. \nAqerbic states hope that after the death of this bloodlusted king they will be able to regain their ancestral home. Will they succeed? Will Narbona dominate over the peninsula? Or maybe a new power will emerge, created by increasingly rebellious dukes?\n\n[Root.StartScreenUpLeftDesc_bottom]"

 ARG_desc_SS: "King Osmund I was not the greatest king - he managed to lose land not only to the Sointuva invaders, but also to those treacherous Ehrens. After his (too long) reign ended in 1442, the kingdom was split between his 2 sons - Sexbald and Osmund. Both of those men claim to be the true rulers of the dragon throne, but most of other nations refer to them by their ducal title - duchy of Ethelnothdun and duchy of Anginneowu. As of 1444, the conflict between these two mostly devolved to insignificant skirmishes and raids. Despite this, both of them have been arming themselves and waiting for an opportunity to strike - will Argenia finally reunite?\n\n[Root.StartScreenUpLeftDesc_bottom]"

 WED_desc_SS: "§YWedlan§! people have always had a strong sense of national identity. They developed their state and converted to §YSigilianism§! independently from Bogiland thanks to the §YOstemer§! merchants frequently trading with the local natives for coniferous wood and amber. After some time, they became oversea merchants on their own by expanding their influence in §YMarstonia§!. This is the time the city of §YHercogaosta§! was founded to spread §YSaelian§! believes and smoothen the trade with the §YAligeris§!.\n\nRecently, the island of §YLara§! came under Wedlan protection after the local ruler drowned in debt. This led the WGH - §YWedlanka Gildija Handlowa§! - to increasing its presence in the §YMezonian strait§! by becoming a guild in the city of §YZirgukalnis§! to dissatisfaction of the Mezonian rulers.\n\nAs Wedlan power and ambitions grow, so do their neighbors'. §YZiemelia§! managed to defeat Wedla and seize many of their border settlements, while the kingdom of §YBogiland§! plans to finally seize the prosperous trading city of §YDoniepr§!. Will Wedla defy the odds and dominate over the Ostsee?\n\n~+§YMysentria§!+~\n\n[Root.StartScreenUpLeftDesc_bottom]"

 string_start_religion_sigilian: "[Root.start_religion_intro]\n\nThe §YSigilian§! faith belongs to the §YSaelian§! group.\n\nAll Sigilian §Ycountries§! have access to §YImperial Allegiance§! mechanic. It represents how much the country is independent from the religious decisions of the current Saelian Emperor.\n\nAs the game goes on, the §!Sigilian religious tension§! will slowly increase based on decisions taken by various countries and the emperor. When it reaches §Y100%§! it will kickstart the §YLiemarian reformation§!."

 string_start_saelian_empire: "Mysentria is home to the §YSaelian Empire§!, a giant, but largely divided, Empire that dominates the §YSilvestrine§! and §YRevorian§! lands. Upon the death of an §YEmperor§! the §YTetrarchy§! selects his replacement by voting.\n\nCountries within the Saelian Empire are allowed their own diplomacy and can even have their own subjects, but the Emperor is obligated to defend them from outside forces and can demand that they hand back §YUnlawfully Acquired Territory§! within the Empire.\n\nWhile the §YAuthority§! of the Emperor is currently low, this may change if the Emperor can strengthen his hold through §YImperial Reforms§!.\n\n[Root.start_imperial_cities_description]Every §Y25 years§! the emperor can call §Ythe Imperial Diet§!. During the diet, member states will be able to request §YImperial Grace§! on conquest within the empire. Emperor will be able to increase his authority or even justify a war against one of his subjects.\n\nOnly §YSigilian§! countries can become the emperor of the Saelian empire. If no eligible country exists, the empire will be dismantled. Additionaly, §YLiemarian§! are very likely to leave the empire upon conversion.\n\nOnce the Liemarian power consolidates enough, they will be able to form a §YGreat Coalition§! against the empire with the goal of dismantling it. If the empire manages to survive, the §Yreformation§! will be greatly weakened and §Yemperor's authority§! strengthened."
