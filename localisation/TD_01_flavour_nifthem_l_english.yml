 ## Events

 randwerpen.1.t: "Randwerpen and Ehrenstaat"
 randwerpen.1.desc: "Ehren ambition to become sole economic hegemon on the north required for them to have huge industrial base that was lacking on Ehren islands. Thats when first ideas to integrate Nifthem and Tummland emerged, with first being more favourable to the leadership. From this time Ehrenstaat started to tighten their grip in their sphere of influence with mass vassalization and forceful integration of cities into Ehren administration in first half of XV ceuntry.\nThis rapid Ehren expansion didn't go unnoticed as Saelian Empire started to support idea of integration of Bloemrijkland into the Empire and Randwerpen deciding to unify entire region to stop Ehren agression. Alerted leadership of Randwerpen started mass militarisation and consolidation of the realm to protect against the future invasion."

 randwerpen.2.t: "Nobles displeased"
 randwerpen.2.desc: "The elites are worried with our recent territorial gains due to the original plan being to use our military funding to protect the state and people of Nifthem from Ehreni threats. It is now apparent that the rulership used threat of foreign invasion as a way to increase their power. Many nobles and burghers now refuse to fight in any future wars."
 randwerpen.2.a: "It's not what you think!"

 randwerpen.4.desc: "Perfidious Ehrens attacked our nation to consolidate their control over these lands. We won't allow it to happen!"
 randwerpen.4.a: "To war!"

 randwerpen.5.t: "Fate of Nifthem"
 randwerpen.5.desc: "We won against Ehrenstaat and because of it we took lands that they occupied, but now the question of their puppet states arise. We recieved control over them from Ehrenstaat, keeping them would allow us to finally unite entirety of Nifthem under one nation. But these states don't want to recognise our rule and keeping them under our rule could be disastrous. Should we keep them or allow them to decide their own fate."
 randwerpen.5.a: "Enforce our rule"

 randwerpen.6.t: "Peace Proposition"
 randwerpen.6.desc: "Ehrenstaat and its elite is tired from this war and want to accept defeat, but we would need to trade treaties that would keep ehren trade superiority in our region. Accepting this deal won't completely defeat Ehrenstaat and force some of our trade to still go into their coffers but it completes our goals without any need to spill more blood."
 randwerpen.6.a: "Accept it"
 randwerpen.6.b: "Bleed them dry"
