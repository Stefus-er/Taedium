 randwerpen.1.desc:0 "Ehren ambition to become sole economic hegemon on the north required for them to have huge industrial base that was lacking on Ehren islands. Thats when first ideas to integrate Nifthem and Tummland emerged, with first being more favourable to the leadership. From this time Ehrenstaat started to tighten their grip in their sphere of influence with mass vassalization and forceful integration of cities into Ehren administration in first half of XV ceuntry.\nThis rapid Ehren expansion didn't go unnoticed as Saelian Empire started to support idea of integration of Bloemrijkland into the Empire and Randwerpen deciding to unify entire region to stop Ehren agression. Alerted leadership of Randwerpen started mass militarisation and consolidation of the realm to protect against the future invasion."

People are slowly starting to lose faith in the militaristic government and go back to their normal boring lives.\nBut in recent days, one of the ministers proposed a new way to stir up the Randwerpian fervor - what if we were the ones attacking Ehrenstaat to free our enslaved brethrens?"
