 halberd_infantry: "Halberd Infantry"
 halberd_infantryDESCR: "Infantry units equipped with axe-headed poles with pikes. Halberds came into regular use during the 14th and 15th century and were mainly developed to combat heavily armored troops more effectively."

 imperial_knights: "Imperial Knights"
 imperial_knightsDESCR: "The medieval Knight originated in the eneratian kingdoms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread west, reaching sigilian world and becaming an integral part of the feudal system, in which knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."

 chevaliers: "Chevaliers"
 chevaliersDESCR: "The Chevaliers was made up of smaller groups of light cavalry units and was mainly used for raiding and pillaging. The Chevaliers tactic was successfully employed during both the Narbonese conquests and rise of Chilverchian marches."

 western_men_at_arms: "Men at Arms"
 western_men_at_armsDESCR: "The Man at Arms was a professional soldier in Mysentrian armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier. During the War of Nevledian succession, Men at Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants at Arms."

 western_longbow: "Longbow"
 western_longbowDESCR: "The longbow was a missile weapon mostly used by infantry from Argenia and Nabhin from the 14th to the 16th century. The weapon was very accurate and had a long range and was powerful enough to penetrate chain-mail armor. The Argenians used this weapon with great success in the Eoredygian succession. With the development of gunpowder, the longbow became obsolete. This was not because it was less powerful than the early muskets but because to become a good longbow-man, you had to train for many years, while training people to use fire-arms was much easier."

 condotta_infantry: "Condotta Infantry"
 condotta_infantryDESCR: "Condotta is the Revorian word for 'contract' and it was used to describe the mercenary units that fought mostly in Camaria for the various city-states. The leaders of a Condotta regiment were called Condottiere. Condotta were not very loyal to their employers often switching sides because of higher pay. When Condotta fought each other they also made deals to not harm each other too much and war in Camaria often became a sort of theater. Condotta regiments consisted of armored knights and heavy and light infantry and crossbowmen. The Condotta had a monopoly on warfare in Camaria which meant that they still used old weapons and tactics when the other Mysentrian armies already had switched to infantry consisting of musketeers and pikemen."

 reformed_gyrdian_infantry: "Reformed Gyrdian Infantry"
 reformed_gyrdian_infantryDESCR: "As gunpowder weaponry and drill techniques spread through Mysentria the traditional Labosian methods of warfare began to become obsolete - the time of the war bands and the Oileamer pikemen was coming to an end. However Dorchean and Gyrdian mercenaries were still feared as fighters, especially by the invading Argenian armies. Those who adapted to the new techniques were highly valued for their bravery and courage, notably the Bryncaff clan of Nabhin and the butchers of Arei. After the 16th century many Labosian mercenaries could also be found in armies throughout Mysentria, notably during the war of the first coalition."

 nahtrucer_landsknechten: "Landsknecht Infantry"
 nahtrucer_landsknechtenDESCR: "Landsknechte were a type of infantry first created in the early 16th century in the Saelian Empire. They were mostly armed with a long spear or pike. George von Frundsberg is considered to be the creator of the Landsknechte. The Landsknechte fought mostly in a square type formation called the Pike Square. They were also famous for the elaborate clothing they wore on the battlefield."

 gyrdian_infantry: "Gyrdian Infantry"
 gyrdian_infantryDESCR: "'Blue Guards' were mercenary bands from the northern Mysentria who mixed traditional Gyrdian and Silvestrine styles of warfare to great effect. Like many Gyrdian warriors before them, the blue guards used the two-handed battle-axe, but were also well-armored in the Noorden style with chain mail and helmets. They appeared in Dorchia from the mid thirteenth century and soon became highly sought-after warriors in the service of many Oileamer clans, right through to the sixteenth century. The Blue Guards fought alongside their retainers in what was known as a 'spar', consisting of the warrior, his kern (a squire armed with pike or javelin) and his horse-boy (armed with a shortbow or a sheaf of darts). Collectively these spars would group in war-bands, or Corrughadh, which could number over a hundred strong. The Blue Guards were feared by the Argenians as, whilst no match for a heavy medieval army in the open field, they proved a deadly force in small, close confrontations. As a result they were often used by Nabhini lords as shock troops in ambush situations. These islander warriors did also find success on the open battlefield, most notably at Cheiwald in 1301."

 niftrend_cavalry: "Niftrend Cavalry"
 niftrend_cavalryDESCR: "Light cavalrymen of eastern Nifthem are characterized for they ability to get quickly in and out of fight, dealing damage to the enemy backlines and flanks. They were often hired as cheap mercenaries, especially by northern Saelian states in their wars against the Gyrdians."

 schwarze_reiter: "Schwarze Reiter"
 schwarze_reiterDESCR: "Black Riders (for the color of their armor) are cavalrymen each equipped with two pistols and a sword, often wearing a cuirass for protection. They were used by many Saelian states in the 16th and 17th centuries. Using firearms as their primary weapons they broke with the medieval knight tradition of cavalrymen always being equipped with lances. In battle they would fire their pistols at the enemy line, then attempt a charge and melee combat to rout enemy soldiers."

 pistoleros_infantry: "Pistoleros Infantry"
 pistoleros_infantryDESCR: "Heavily disciplined and organized Pistoleros originated in Novoregno thanks to the efforts of Ramiro de Balucarra, who was the first one to use this formation in the battle of Escerro in 1531. They employ both modern muskeets and traditional pikes, to effectively overwhelm the enemy and easily defend potential cavalry attacks."

 snaiwatzer_free_shooter: "Snaiwatzer Free Shooter"
 snaiwatzer_free_shooterDESCR: "The development of better firearms forced a change in tactics for the Silvestrine mercenaries. These hardy warriors would now await the first volley from the enemy and then unleash their irresistible charge."

 salish_caracole: "Salish Caracole Cavalry"
 salish_caracoleDESCR: "In the late 16th and early 17th century the most common combat formation for Mysentrian cavalry was the Caracole, which could be employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged frontally against the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."

 reformed_chevaliers: "Reformed Chevaliers"
 reformed_chevaliersDESCR: "Due to the increased importance of firearms in warfare, many sought to adapt their traditional ways of fighting to not fall behind their rivals. This led to improved performance of chevaliers, which now included wheelock pistols and muskets to attack the enemy more safely from a distance, retreating to reload and repeating the maneuver."

 nordmarker_charge: "Nordmarker Charge Infantry"
 nordmarker_chargeDESCR: "The linear descendants of the Gyrdian mercenaries of early eras, but much more disciplined. These units placed maximum emphasis on infantry charges to kill and unnerve their enemies. Their charge could be more devastating than the cavalry of the era making them fearsome in attack."

 dorchean_infantry: "Dorchean Infantry"
 dorchean_infantryDESCR: "In the 16th century, the musket (a handheld firearm) became commonplace, but they were very slow to reload. Army tacticians typically deployed musket-men in formations to maximize firepower. The muskets would thus be arranged in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. This maximized the firepower of the 16th century muskets and overcame their disadvantage of slow reloading. It was Alwin of Lotveld who pioneered the use of these musket formations and taught it to Dorchean troops in the Gyrdian wars. His development of military strategy and tactics made the Dorchean army the most modern in Europe."

 rubmen_gallop: "Rubmen Gallop"
 rubmen_gallopDESCR: "The pistol armed Caracole Cavalry came to dominate Mysentrian cavalry tactics in the South, although the traditional shock action cavalry style of the Hussars was still in use. Armies trained in the Mysentrian warfare quite often came out second best in combat against these units. Borne out of the bloodshed of the Camarian wars, the Rubmeans developed a different kind of unit, the Rubmen Gallop Cavalry. Although still armed with pistols like the caracole they did not discharge their pistols before the shock action but as a part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the coalition wars, forcing the Imperial Caracole cavalry to adapt very quickly."

 bogiler_gallop: "Bogiler Gallop Cavalry"
 bogiler_gallopDESCR: "Bogilish cavalrymen were feared for most of their aggressive charges at the enemy lines, often quickly disrupting their formations and leading to quick defeat. In the age of gunpowder these tactics had to be adapted to much more easily resist enemy fire, by focusing on flanking the enemy with small groups."

 reformed_pistoleros: "Reformed Pistoleros"
 reformed_pistolerosDESCR: "The Pistoleros, or Aqerb Square, was a mixed formation of pikemen and musketeers developed by the Padosi General Gonzalo Fernandez de Escerro. The victory of the Novoregnian armies against Narbona would lead to its domination of the Mysentrian battlefield for 100 years. The early Pistoleros contained anywhere from 50-70% pikemen. However, the Pistoleros were still evolving and through experimentation it was found that the number of pikemen required could be reduced. These late Pistoleros could have as little as 25% pikemen leading to a massive increase in the formations' firepower."

 ansgarlander_infantry: "Ansgarlander Infantry"
 ansgarlander_infantryDESCR: "In the early 17th century the musket had a loading time that was still very slow and musket fire needed to be concentrated in volleys to be destructive, as the weapons were very inaccurate and misfires were common. Such a slow reloading time meant that the unit would be very vulnerable if all the guns were fired simultaneously. Since the days of Alwin of Lotveld this problem was overcome by arranging the unit in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. Siegfried II von Angelsei, the Ansgarlander king, significantly improved this Alwinian infantry tactic. He trained his troops so well that he was able to reduce the number of ranks to only three (one kneeling, the second crouching and, the third standing) and yet still maintain continuous fire."

 argenian_shooters: "Argenian Shooters"
 argenian_shootersDESCR: "The Highland Infantry divisions which make up such a recognizable force in many of today's Dorchean armies have their roots in the semi-feudal clan system of late Caidthmor. Nabhinis were lightly armored clansmen, often equipped with the traditional basket-hilted sword, the claymore, as well as small knives, known as dirks. Later Highland soldiers also carried pistols. They were feared for the ferocity of their attack, particularly the famous Highland Charge, used to smash through enemy lines. Following the Stanrocc rebellion, the Highlanders were gradually assimilated into the Argenian army. The first such Highland troops were the Black Watch, or 42nd Highland Regiment of Foot. The Highland Regiments subsequently became a feared fighting force, noted in particular for bravery and a refusal to surrender."

 vinalien_infantry: "Vinalien Infantry"
 vinalien_infantryDESCR: "After the conquest of Revoria during the turbulent 16th century, Vinalion formed a new type of unit called Randonneurs (which translated means trekkers) to defend the borders of their newly conquered lands against the Camarians. The men were recruited from the local population and were given land in return for their military service. Randonneurs regiments were considered light infantry. They mostly fought in a skirmishing role but could also function as infantry of the line and were able to quickly relocate due to their relatively lightweight equipment."

 donucakari_infantry: "Donuçakari Infantry"
 donucakari_infantryDESCR: "The military reforms of the late Donuçakari a new force of infantry, specializing in the attack. Devastating volleys of musket rounds would be the prelude to a mass charge."

 line_infantry: "Line Infantry"
 line_infantryDESCR: "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock. Their aim would be to use the musket volleys to disorganize the enemy before they could charge, in particular if they were primarily a shock action force."

 ignider_cavalry: "Ignider Cavalry"
 ignider_cavalryDESCR: "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock, and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, the arme blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."

 imperial_dragoon: "Imperial Dragoons"
 imperial_dragoonDESCR: "In the 17th century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon. Dragoons were widely used by all Mysentrian nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."

 ziemelian_hussars: "Ziemelian Hussars"
 ziemelian_hussarsDESCR: "For a long time in Mysentria Cavalry was the prince of the battlefield. The heavily armored knights would deliver murderous cavalry charges and the masters of this tactics were the Bogilish cavalrymen. To counteract this, states such as Ziemelia developed a lighter cavalry, which was able to outmaneuver the enemies and give them a large advantage by dismantling enemy's main attacking force."

 ehren_blue_coat: "Blue Coat Infantry" #ehrenstaat
 ehren_blue_coatDESCR: "Having its beginning on the Ehren military frontier fighting the Tummic cavalry based armies, the Blue Coats were drilled and equipped primarily to resist cavalry charges.

 kaposnicy_cavalryDESCR: "The prototype of Kaposnicy were created in the early 18th Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more the Heavily Armored Cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on in the 18th Century they became an essential part of the military's structure due to their light armor making them fast and agile on the battlefield and for their high shock value against their enemies, which in some cases turned the tide in Battles. The Kaposnicy, named after founder of this formation, were a good alternative to large Infantry Armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller Nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."

 reformed_imperial_hussars: "Reformed Imperial Hussars"
 reformed_imperial_hussarsDESCR: "As Cavalry became more specialized, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the Bogilish Hussar that had first entered Mysentrian warfare and more like the more oriental Kakigian hussar.

 vetican_carabinier: "Vetican Carabiniers"
 vetican_carabinierDESCR: "The Carabiniers first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiniers main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."

 bohemian_impulse: "Impulse Infantry"
 bohemian_impulseDESCR: "During the war of the Bohemian succession, Kriegerstein was facing a serious defeat. parts of Salia had already been lost to Ansgarland and total defeat was not far away. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units for the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the Mysentrian battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."

 narbonese_square: "Square Infantry"
 narbonese_squareDESCR: "During the war of the Bohemian succession, Kriegerstein was facing a serious defeat. parts of Salia had already been lost to Ansgarland and total defeat was not far away. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units for the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the Mysentrian battlefield. However there were those that totally rejected the skirmisher concept and went for rigid linear tactics. Narbonese Square Infantry due to the formation they assumed when defending against cavalry. These were tightly disciplined units trained to fire their muskets at a high rate and fire by platoon which meant that rather than use the single volley and reload style during combat, these units would always have a platoon discharging their muskets. The deadly ripple fire could break any assault. However, rigid linear tactics made these units less mobile and more defensive."

 chilverchian_cuirassierDESCR: "The Cuirassiers was a type of heavy cavalry that emerged in the late 15th century. This type of cavalry was armored from his head down to knee-level. His body was protected with a breastplate, the Cuirass from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords. Cuirassiers were mostly used as shock-cavalry and were in use during almost the whole time span focused upon in this game."

 mixed_order_infantry: "Mixed Order Infantry"

 hermannian_drill: "Hermannian Drill Infantry"
 hermannian_drillDESCR: "Drilled Soldiers were soldiers that had been vigorously trained, so that they would know exactly what to do in a battle situation. They were also less likely to break ranks whilst fighting against the enemy. An example would be the Asngarlander Drilled Soldiers. They were among the world's best trained and equipped soldiers at the time. They were very disciplined and well trained for nearly any situation. So good was their reputation that the American Colonies had asked for Prussian drill instructors to be sent to train the colonists so they could fight against the Argenians and Dorcheans."

 erwinian_infantry: "Erwinian Infantry"

 mesiheisi_pike: "Pike Infantry"
 mesiheisi_pikeDESCR: "When the Goths defeated the Romans at the battle of Adrianople, it heralded a new era in European warfare. Cavalry became the dominant force on the battlefield and infantry relegated to supplying a base for Cavalry to maneuver round.

 kakigian_hussarDESCR: "In medieval times, mounted knights had dominated the medieval battlefield but afterwards were replaced by musketeers and pikemen. In the 17th century, cavalry forces were still used for a surprise effect in battles, but had often little chance against disciplined pikemen. Therefore, cavalry forces were little used in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe with its vast steppes, cavalry remained very important. The winged Hussars played a key role there. The Polish developed an excellent curved saber (the 'palasz'), selected horses specially for their speed and endurance and they carried lances with them, of six meters, that could pierce a pikemen's armor. The winged Hussars became a heavily armored cavalry that fought countless victorious actions against a variety of enemies. They played a key role in John Sobieski's legendary lifting of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. John Sobieski sent four Hussar cavalry groups in a furious charge that broke the Turkish battle line, scattering them in confusion. This victory by the winged Polish Hussars saw John Sobieski hailed as the 'savior of Vienna'."

The design of this late medieval ship combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense."
 carrackDESCR: "The design of the carrack, a late medieval ship, combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense. Some carracks such as the English vessel 'Henri Grâce à Dieu' weighed more than 1,000 tons, had large fore and aft castles, and could be considered as the greatest warships of their time."
 caravelDESCR: "The caravel was a small, very maneuverable ship which could sail with a high precision on long discovery journeys. Although designs varied, a caravel had a foresail, a square mainsail and lateen mizzen. Its smaller size limited the number of guns onboard, but it also meant that this light ship could explore shallow coastal waters and estuaries. Vasco Da Gama, Cabot, Columbus and Magellan used caravels during their late 15th century and early 16th century voyages."

 fluteDESCR: "A cargo ship developed in the Netherlands in the 16th century, it was built to maximize cargo-space and crew-efficiency. And it became one of the most commonly used ships in the 16th and 17th century. The standard design wasn't armed but when needed it could be armed with cannons and serve as auxiliary vessels."
 frigateDESCR: "As time passed, the frigate evolved. It became larger and heavily armed, sometimes with two gun decks. The frigate's combination of speed and firepower meant that it could outrun any ship with more guns and outgun any faster ships. The fleet built by the Commonwealth of England in the 1650s consisted almost exclusively of frigates."
 galleassDESCR: "The galleass was an adaptation of the large merchant galley to counter the increasing use of man-of-war. Larger than the galley, the galleass had about 32 oar pairs, each oar manned by up to five man. As an answer to the men-of-war's armament and higher sides, the galleass had forecastles and aftcastles and gundecks above the rowers. This extra weight meant that they also had to rely more on sails, and were slower and less maneuverable compared to galleys. Like the galley, the galleass went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 galleonDESCR: "A large, usually three-masted sailing ship originally designed as a warship but later on used primarily for trade and commerce."
 galleyDESCR: "With roots back to the ancient ships of the antiquity, the galley remained the prime choice for Mediterranean naval warfare until the 16th century. The galley was primarily propelled by oars, usually about 25 pairs manned by up to three men each. This meant that they were less dependent on wind gauge compared to sailing ships, and their maneuverability made them a feared adversary. Eventually, the galley went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 han_bannerDESCR: "Ming infantry troops armed with muskets that were incorporated into the banner system originally created by the Manchus during the 17th century."
 heavy_frigateDESCR: "Two decked vessels normally carrying about 40 guns."
 houfniceDESCR: "It is believed modern howitzers have their name from the Houfnice artillery developed by the Hussites in the 15th century. These short barreled guns were mounted on wagons and used on the field of battle to fire balls and canisters in support of the infantry."
 huron_arquebusierDESCR: "The Tomahawk Warrior had a strong emphasis on fire tactics even before the introduction of gunpowder. Embracing the benefits of these weapons, the Native American Arquebusier put strong emphasis on offensive fire and cohesion in combat. It was not as effective at shock action as the offensive musketeer."
 inca_mountain_warfareDESCR: "As new weapons and tactics became available the hardy mountain warriors began to improve. These warriors still placed a premium of defense, relying on their staying power for victory. The improvements in armor and training made victory over these units a tough undertaking."
 iroquois_rifle_scoutDESCR: "The Rifle Scout is a unit that specializes in harassment of the enemy. This unit may not be able to last as long in combat as a more disciplined unit. However these warriors are excellent marksmen and their prowess with the rifle can cause some serious damage to the enemy."
 japanese_archerDESCR: "The Asian archers were the most important force in Asian battles during this era. The bows were typically made of bamboo but generally longer than the European ones."
 japanese_footsoldierDESCR: "The foot soldiers were the lowest form of warriors within the hierarchy of the time. They consisted of commoners and the lower class nobles, and were the mainstay of the ruler's army. At first, the foot soldiers were only mercenaries and adventurers, and were paid with looted goods but later on they became a core part of the local lord's army. As battles, wars and the larger size of armies became more complex, they were vigorously trained so they could hold their ground against the oncoming enemy forces. Foot soldiers were mostly armed with spears but some did carry swords/katanas and others were used to operate war machinery, as well as being equipped with varying bows. Foot soldiers generally had light armor, consisting of leather pads sown together or a mixture between leather and iron/copper armors. This made them more agile on the battlefield but at times vulnerable against their opponents. In later periods foot soldiers were given firearms as well."
 japanese_samuraiDESCR: "Samurai were the noblemen of the time in Japan. Samurai meant 'to serve'. They were well educated, and were extremely well trained in fighting. They combined their fighting with arts and literature as past times. The Samurai were governed by a codex which was called Bushido meaning 'Way of the Warrior'. If their lord died or lost a war, they would be required to commit Seppuku (self assisted suicide) as part of the Bushido Code. The Samurai were expected to do the same thing and follow their master into the next life. The Samurai was a feared opponent on the battlefield due to them being highly trained in the fighting arts. They could wield a katana with great skill or use the yumi (Japanese longbow) either mounted or on foot."
 large_cast_bronze_mortarDESCR: "The largest cannons of the time were so enormous in size that they required hundreds of men and oxen to move them. They had an immense destruction power but could only fire a limited amount of times during the day due to the difficulties in loading and aiming these beasts."
 large_cast_iron_bombardDESCR: "A larger version of the standard Bombard. This piece of early European siege artillery was designed for launching heavy objects at enemy defenses. A notable example of a Large Bombard is Mons Meg, which was sent as a gift by Philip III of Burgundy to King James II of Scotland in 1453. Although they were devastating weapons, the larger Bombards took a long time to cool down after each firing, meaning they were of limited usefulness on the battlefield and remained largely for use during sieges."
 leather_cannonDESCR: "The Leather Cannon was first used by the armies of King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden during the third Polish-Swedish War. European artillery at this time was too large and heavy to be mobile on a battlefield, and was only really used during sieges. The introduction of a lighter, mobile cannon enabled the Swedes to maneuver their artillery to meet the movements of the enemy and gave them a distinct tactical advantage over their foes. Unfortunately the leather cannon used by the Swedes had a particular weakness which made it highly impractical. Consisting of a narrow copper tube covered in leather strapping and rope, its wrapping caused the cannon to overheat dangerously during continuous use. Nevertheless the Leather Cannon marked the beginning of the development of light field artillery and the concept of taking heavy firepower to the enemy."

 steppe_mounted_raiders: "Mounted Steppe Raiders"
 steppe_mounted_raidersDESCR: "As time progressed both the development of firearms and the tactics to make use of them improved.

As cannons got lighter and smaller some could also be brought on horseback to be put to use in the ever changing frontiers of the plains."
 steppe_cavalry: "Steppe Cavalry"
 steppe_cavalryDESCR: "Steppe cavalry would continue to excel at raiding, skirmishing and reconnaissance and many sedentary countries on the border of the Steppes would come to employ Cossacks, Tartars and other Steppe horsemen for these purposes.

 steppe_uhlans: "Steppe Uhlans"
 steppe_uhlansDESCR: "In time steppe armies would come to rely less on looting and pilaging to cover their operating costs and more on receiving pay from a centralized command.

 steppe_raiders: "Steppe Raiders"
 steppe_raidersDESCR: "While they would make an early entry firearms where slow to make a big difference on the steppes due to the mobile nature of warfare.

Protected by the wagon forts infantry could make use of fire arms and bows while still remaining safe from cavalry attacks."
 steppe_musketeers: "Steppe Musketeers"
 steppe_musketeersDESCR: "To be effective on the Steppes infantry continued to create mobile forts on the battlefields from which lighter muskets and cannon could be brought to bear on the enemy without the risk of cavalry shocks from the lighter steppe cavalry breaking their formations.

 steppe_infantry: "Steppe Infantry"
 steppe_infantryDESCR: "With cannons and fire arms getting lighter and more accurate the Steppe wagon forts could be used more offensively.

The cannons used where of small of calibre that they could be brought on horseback with the host as it moved over the Steppes."
 steppe_rifles: "Steppe Rifles"
 steppe_riflesDESCR: "While the basics of steppe warfare did not change the general evolution of warfare would in time lead to a number of developments to the armies of the hosts. As sedentary powers pushed back the borders of the free Steppes, fortifying formerly nomadic areas and creating their own regiments of Cossacks, Tartars, and the like the Steppe countries themselves would often come to be dominated by and adapt the better weapons and more organized ideas of their neighbors."
 reformed_steppe_rifles: "Reformed Steppe Rifles"
