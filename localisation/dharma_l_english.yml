The Bahmani Sultans, once the subjects of an empire based in this very city, has now added themselves to the list of conquerors. As the city burns, Bahmani soldiers collect their spoils.

As the armies of Mewar descended upon the ancient city, it seems they must have found it the most important to mark the end of Sultanate rule however.\nWhile the looting is not comparable to when the city fell to Timur's armies monuments have been torn down and treasures looted.

They have become highly influential of late in [Root.Country.GetName], and many important positions in the administration are now held by Brahmins. Having become comfortable in their grand appointments, these Brahmins have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a series of demands. They require that certain administrative posts be entrusted to the Brahmins by law, that Brahmin customs become mandatory at court, and even that several of the highest ministerial offices be held by Brahmin families in heredity. Outrageous as these demands are, the influence of the Brahmins is such that refusing could seriously hinder our ability to govern."

The Brahmins jealously guard their monopoly on Sanskrit education, keeping as their exclusive domain the ability to preach the Vedas.

 brahmins_estate_events.5.d: "More than any other caste the influence of the Brahmins is dependent on their standing with the Hindu faithful. It has been hard to determine a precise cause but they have come to be seen less as the custodians of Vedic doctrine and more as rich and corrupted intrigue-makers. Combined with poor political maneuvering and lack of favor in the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the Brahmins have been losing both power and influence."
 brahmins_estate_events.5.a: "Okay."
 brahmins_estate_events.6.t: "Brahmins Incite Popular Rebellion"

It is visited often by Muslim traders from Gujarat, Arabia, and Persia, and [brahmin_trade_province.GetName] has profited from strong commercial connections with these merchants.\n\n[brahmin_trade_province.GetName] has come to be administered by a group of Brahmin clerics whose influence has been felt at every level of society.

While Brahmins have long been entrenched into [Root.Country.GetName]’s bureaucracy, it is rare for Brahmins to have an explicitly political role even in the courts of Hindu nations.\nThe appointment of this Brahmin as Peshwa, the highest appointed ministerial office, is an appealing prospect. Though Brahmins throughout [Root.Country.GetName] would take the opportunity to increase their influence, it would assure our Hindu subjects that we have their best interests at heart."

 brahmins_estate_events.9.d: "The Brahmins have traditionally had a monopoly on Hindu religious authority, but occasionally religious movements emerge that challenge Brahminism. Such movements are becoming popular throughout [Root.Country.GetName] in spite of Brahmin efforts to suppress them. Exponents of popular religion argue that the Brahmins have wiped off the sacred marks from their foreheads and eschewed their spiritual responsibilities in order to occupy seats of temporal power and mete out injustice to the poor. They declare that selfless devotion is the only path to salvation, a virtue that can be attained by any sufficiently fervent Hindu.\n\nA group of influential Brahmins have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pleading for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] aid in restoring public confidence in Brahmin authority and suppressing non-Brahmin Hindu movements."

 brahmins_estate_events.10.d: "The court of [Root.Country.GetName] has become embroiled in a conflict between the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the military castes. In the wake of these rising tensions, the matter of fort stewardship has risen to our attention. The fort of [brahmin_fort_province.GetName], currently held by a particularly contentious general, lies in a province where the Brahmins are gaining influence of their own.\n\nForeseeing the potential for tensions to break out into hostilities, it may be wise to transfer control of this important fort from the contentious general to the Brahmins. Though less adept than military men at siegecraft, the Brahmins are at least loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Alternatively, the general could be persuaded to change his attitude in exchange for the retention of his privileges in [brahmin_fort_province.GetName]."

 brahmins_estate_events.11.t: "The Status of the Brahmins in [Root.Country.GetName]"
 brahmins_estate_events.11.d: "As a Muslim nation, the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ expects that our government be in accordance with [Root.Religion.GetName] doctrine. Heathens should be stripped of their social influence, should pay the jizya tax, and most certainly should not be allowed to occupy positions of power in the administration.\n\nIt has been difficult to comply with their demands for strict piety however given that so many of our subjects follow the Hindu faith and venerate the priestly Brahmin caste. Even among Muslim nations in India the Brahmins commonly hold positions in the state bureaucracy and aid the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with local rulership. To many at court, to discount the advantages of Brahmin loyalty would be a great folly.\n\n[Root.Country.GetName] must consider wisely the path it wishes to tread with regards to its treatment of the Brahmins, and indeed of the Hindu population as a whole."

 vaisyas_estate_events.2.d: "A host of social and economic problems in [Root.Country.GetName] have led to an eruption of highway banditry throughout the realm. Banditry has become so prolific that some cities have not received a single trade caravan in months.\n\nSeveral bandit leaders are seen as folk heroes by the local populace, bravely resisting the rule of the parasitic state of [Root.Country.GetName], founding new frontier towns, and recruiting local labor. Drawing into their ranks Hindus and Muslims, toddy-tappers and smiths, the bandits have attracted widespread support.\n\nA direct military confrontation with the bandits would solve the immediate problem if we could root them out from their makeshift forts.

Seeking to advance their station, the representatives of the Vaishya guilds have requested that sufficiently esteemed members of their caste be allowed the right to ride palanquins and blow conch shells during certain ceremonies.

Merchants come from far off lands to purchase goods that we produce in abundance, but which to them are exotic luxuries.\n\nThe key to our success in these industries has been our patronage of various guilds who draw their membership from the Vaishya caste.

Decades of neglect and a series of unexpected droughts in [drylands_province.GetName] have led to poor harvests, a steady decline in land revenue, and a trend towards migration away from the drylands and towards the wealthy cities of the coast.\n\nThe situation in [drylands_province.GetName] could however be reversed through the construction of canals and water tanks, ensuring enough water to allow the population to grow and for agriculture to expand. While this would end the stagnation in [drylands_province.GetName], it would draw our focus away from our coastal trading settlements. We must consider which is more valuable to us at the present time."

 vaisyas_estate_events.11.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] society is increasingly becoming more concerned with trade, industry, and profit than on martial endeavors. Many nobles, especially from the ranks of the Kshatriya warrior castes, are concerned that our nation is becoming soft and ill-prepared for war as Princes prefer to devote themselves to commerce rather than military studies. Representatives of the Vaishya caste argue not only that war is bad for business, but that a nation without full coffers cannot wage war effectively. We must decide whether to promote a mercantile or a martial society."

 rajputs_estate_events.1.a: "Ok."
 rajputs_estate_events.2.t: "Advancing Power of the Rajputs"
 rajputs_estate_events.2.d: "The Rajputs have seen their influence increase in [Root.Country.GetName]. The machinations of a well-connected aristocracy, a strong sense of kin identity, and a growing reputation as indomitable warriors have all contributed to their rising power. We can expect the Rajputs to play a greater role in [Root.GetAdjective] affairs in the immediate future."
 rajputs_estate_events.3.t: "Declining Power of the Rajputs"
 rajputs_estate_events.3.d: "A series of internecine struggles brought about by feuding kin groups has weakened Rajput influence in [Root.Country.GetName]. Unable or unwilling to devote their full attention to [Root.GetAdjective] political or military affairs, their influence at court has very much suffered."
 rajputs_estate_events.4.t: "Marriage Alliances with the Rajputs"
 rajputs_estate_events.4.d: "Kinship is of paramount importance to the Rajput clans, and as such there is no better way to cement their loyalty than by forging marriage alliances. Several of the most powerful Rajput thakurs have offered to wed their daughters into our line in exchange for a guarantee that they will continue to hold their ancestral lands and titles. Though some among the Rajput leaders consider this an unacceptable act of sublimation, those that have offered marriage ties do so with plans to advance their position at court."
 rajputs_estate_events.4.a: "Let them consider us kin."
 rajputs_estate_events.4.b: "We don't need their friendship."
 rajputs_estate_events.5.t: "Rajput Scion Seeks New Territory"
 rajputs_estate_events.5.d: "Rajput power in India is predicated on centuries of conquest, colonization, and settlement of lands beyond their power base in Rajasthan. A particularly bold and ambitious scion of a notable clan has appeared at court on a quest to enhance the prestige of his kin. Approaching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], he asks permission to settle [rajput_scion_province.GetName], where he shall found a new town. He promises in exchange to accept the rule of the [Root.Country.GetAdjective] state and to raise an army in our support whenever it is needed."

 rajputs_estate_events.5.b: "We can administer these lands perfectly well ourselves."
 rajputs_estate_events.6.t: "The Rajputs Make Demands"
 rajputs_estate_events.6.d: "Rajput nobles have come to both outnumber and outrank all other nobility at the [Root.GetAdjective] court. They know well the power they wield over our armies and our administration, and have leveraged this power to demand extreme concessions to Rajput nobles and their territories. Our attempts to curb their power through subtle means have had little effect, and so we must consider taking drastic action; either we must accept that the Rajputs are a law unto themselves, or we must strip them of their noble ranks to restore balance to the court."
 rajputs_estate_events.6.a: "We will allow them to govern themselves, for now."
 rajputs_estate_events.6.b: "Curb their power, strip the leaders of rank and title!"
 rajputs_estate_events.7.t: "Integration of Rajput Nobility"
 rajputs_estate_events.7.d: "Rajput nobles are a common sight at the court of [Root.Country.GetName], though it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between them and the other courtiers that make their home in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The Rajputs at court have been thoroughly integrating into [Root.GetAdjective] aristocratic society, going so far as to learn the Persian language, observe [Root.GetAdjective] courtly etiquette, and personally accompany the [Root.Monarch.GetName] wherever [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] goes. This is leading to the loss of a distinctly Rajput voice at court, as these nobles have become more concerned with their personal advancement than in the interests of the Rajput community."
 rajputs_estate_events.7.a: "Encourage integration."
 rajputs_estate_events.7.b: "Discourage integration."
 rajputs_estate_events.8.t: "The Rajput Rebellion"
 rajputs_estate_events.8.d: "Relations between [Root.Country.GetName] and the Rajput clans could hardly be worse. The marginalization of Rajput nobles and the neglect of Rajput soldiers has created an atmosphere of resentment and distrust that now threatens to erupt into violent conflict. Though it has become traditional for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to formally appoint Rajput clan leaders, in the current state of crisis our preferred candidate has been unanimously rejected by his would-be subjects. The Rajputs of [Root.Country.GetName] now demand the right to appoint their own leadership, and to be left to govern their own affairs in provinces they control. They are prepared to install their chosen leader by force if we insist on maintaining our chokehold on dynastic politics."
 rajputs_estate_events.8.a: "We must avoid conflict. Grant them autonomy."
 rajputs_estate_events.8.b: "Force them to accept our rule."
 rajputs_estate_events.9.t: "Rajput Dharma"
 rajputs_estate_events.9.d: "The cornerstone of Rajput identity is their Dharma, which they derive from the moral guidance in their bardic writings. Every Rajput leader must put kinship above all else, surrounding himself with a brotherhood of warriors and advisors all sharing descent from a patrilineal ancestor. Rajput soldiers must fight and die in service to their masters; nothing but absolute loyalty is acceptable.\n\nRather than attempting to suppress these traditional Rajput values and power structures, [Root.Country.GetName] has encouraged them, harmonizing them with service to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The Rajputs see no contradiction between their Dharma and their duty to us."
 rajputs_estate_events.9.a: "Excellent."
 rajputs_estate_events.10.t: "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ Demand Rajput Conversions"
 rajputs_estate_events.10.d: "Rajput service to the [Root.GetAdjective] state is founded on the unspoken understanding that the Rajputs should be allowed to practice their traditional Hindu religion and face no penalties for failing to convert to Islam.\nLeaders of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have recently become particularly insistent on our adherence to Sharia, demanding that we pressure Rajput leaders to convert and penalize Hindu nobles by restricting their ranks and privileges.\nThough a small number of Rajput nobles have converted, the overwhelming majority are outraged by the $ESTATE_CHURCH$’s actions. They have petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for an immediate guarantee of religious tolerance, demanding that their traditions and customs be respected by law."
 rajputs_estate_events.10.a: "Guarantee religious tolerance and scold the $ESTATE_CHURCH$."
 rajputs_estate_events.10.b: "Pressure Rajput nobles to convert to [Root.Religion.GetName]."
 rajputs_estate_events.11.t: "The Rajput Aristocratic Diaspora"
 rajputs_estate_events.11.d: "Rajput nobility has spread far and wide throughout the centuries, but a strong sense of kinship identity creates a common aristocratic culture. Rajput chiefs know their status and history in relation to other Rajputs going back many generations.\n\nOur advisors, among them many Rajputs, suggest that these bonds could be exploited to the benefit of [Root.Country.GetName]. Most obviously, the Rajput chiefs loyal to us could act as ambassadors to the Rajputs of nearby nations, enhancing our reputation in foreign courts. A more cunning option would be to exploit ancient grudges among the Rajputs as a means to claim foreign territory."

 jains_estate_events.4.d: "The Jain community of [Root.Country.GetName] have become utterly disloyal following many acts of disrespect and persecution by the state. The situation has become great exacerbated by an outrageous act of sacrilege. One of our [Root.Religion.GetName] governors marched into a Jain temple, slaughtered a cow, and desecrated the noses of all the icons inside. Unwilling to accept further persecution, the Jain community has resolved to oppose our government. Their methods of resistance are unorthodox yet effective; rather than rising up in violent rebellion they boycott institutions of state, deny loans, and refuse all participation in government. Our reliance on the Jain community has become a damning vulnerability."

Several Brahmin families also engage in banking. Representatives of these Brahmins argue the case for favoring their services over the Jains.

Members of the Jain community use this time for prayer, meditation, and asking forgiveness from their fellows.\nJain ministers employed in the [Root.GetAdjective] administration have petitioned the state to ask that the slaughter of animals be prohibited for the duration of Paryushana.

The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has charged the Jains with being kafirs, non-believers in God, and have held a debate before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to settle the matter.\n\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ argue that the Jains hold no belief in one who is pure, without physical form, changeless, sinless, emancipated from rebirth, passionless, independent, a slayer of sins, and the architect of all joy. This conception of God, they argue, is shared between Muslims and Hindus but absent among Jains.\n\nThe Jain monks present at the debate fervently repudiate this view. Opting for flexibility, they put forth a multitude of Jain doctrines to demonstrate their theism from the worship of Jina to the very concept of Dharma.\n\nUltimately, it falls upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide the fate of Jainism in [Root.Country.GetName].

These would include the prohibition of animal slaughter, ending the confiscation of the property of the deceased, abolishing religious taxes, and the release of political prisoners with ties to prominent Jain families.\n\nThese proposals have been met with outrage from the [Root.Religion.GetName] clergy, and are likely to be unpopular throughout the realm.

Unlike many Indian armies, which typically draw their manpower from the ranks of the nobility, the Marathas raise legions of peasant-soldiers skilled in guerrilla warfare.

 investment_events.1.t: "Sepoys"
 investment_events.1.d: "The [sepoy_province.TradeCompany.GetName] is always hiring hardy men with military experience. The logistics of recruiting from [Root.Capital.GetName] can be arduous however. Company officers have suggested that a more cost-effective way to bolster Company ranks would be to hire more extensively from the local Indian populace. These ‘sepoy’ regiments are drawn from the upper castes of Indian society, mostly Brahmins and Rajput Kshatriyas, and thus well versed in the ways of war. Many sepoys are willing to serve the Company due to its reputation for honest and fair payment, which has been difficult to find in India of late.\n\nThough a more homogenous army of [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers might be easier to command, we should not ignore the vast pool of manpower available on the subcontinent."
 investment_events.1.a: "Establish new sepoy regiments."
 investment_events.1.b: "We do not need to recruit from the natives."
 investment_events.2.t: "Disagreement over Company Purchases"
 investment_events.2.d: "Whether acquired by conflict or by purchase, treaties recognizing Company ownership of [land_purchase_province.GetName] have become disputed. Land brokers of the [land_purchase_province.TradeCompany.GetName] insist that their rightful territory extends somewhat farther than the land they currently administer.\n\nTheir insistence is motivated by the fact that the land in question has been valued particularly highly by the brokers, who are now insisting that [land_purchase_country.GetName] recognize Company ownership of the border area. [land_purchase_country.GetAdjective] officials have not reacted kindly to this unexpected expansionism, and demand adherence to their interpretation of the treaties."
 investment_events.2.a: "They should have read the fine print."
 investment_events.2.b: "Let it go, we do not need this land."
 investment_events.3.t: "The Opium Trade"
 investment_events.3.d: "Making a profit on trade with China is a conundrum for the [opium_province.TradeCompany.GetName]. China produces sought-after goods such as tea, siks, and porcelain, but there is little we have to exchange in return besides simple gold and silver. This leaves the Company with a trade deficit.\n\nThere is however one commodity that would surely sell in Chinese markets; opium. The fields of [opium_province.GetName] are well-suited to the growing of opium poppies, which the Company could manufacture into the drug. While the opium trade is prohibited throughout [canton_owner.GetName], the Company believes it will have little difficulty smuggling it into Canton regardless. Such illicit actions would surely upset [canton_owner.GetAdjective] authorities, but it is difficult to pass up an opportunity for profit."
 investment_events.3.a: "Smuggle opium into China."
 investment_events.3.b: "We cannot risk Chinese ire."
 investment_events.4.t: "Corrupt Factor"
 investment_events.4.d: "As soon as an appointed factor leaves [Root.Capital.GetName], we expect them to begin lining their own pockets as much as they serve the interests of the [corrupt_factor_province.TradeCompany.GetName]. Rarely, however, are Company officials so egregious in their greed as [Root.corrupt_factor_name.GetName], the factor of [corrupt_factor_province.GetName]. Through his private investments, [Root.corrupt_factor_name.GetName] has cornered the local market in [corrupt_factor_province.GetTradeGoodsName].\n\nInvestors fearing for the reputation of the Company demand that the renegade factor be recalled to [Root.Capital.GetName] to face punishment. More opportunistic elements suggest that we should instead buy out his enterprises, incorporating them into the Company’s operations and rewarding the factor for his initiative."
 investment_events.4.a: "Reward [Root.corrupt_factor_name.GetName]'s initiative."
 investment_events.4.b: "We need to rein in corruption. Recall [Root.corrupt_factor_name.GetName] to [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 investment_events.5.t: "Company Rule"
 investment_events.5.d: "From its humble origins as a joint-stock company, the [company_rule_province.TradeCompany.GetName] has grown beyond a mere association of merchants and administrators. The Company has become a power in its own right, having taken on the function of government in the lands in controls, even commanding its own armies and fleets. The [company_rule_province.TradeCompany.GetName] is truly a force to be reckoned with."
 investment_events.5.a: "Excellent."
 investment_events.6.t: "Missionaries Arrive in [company_missionary_province.GetName]"
 investment_events.6.d: "The [company_missionary_province.TradeCompany.GetName]’s policy of religious tolerance has thus far kept the local [company_missionary_province.Religion.GetName] population content with Company rule.\n\nA group of evangelical missionaries have arrived in [company_missionary_province.GetName] with the intention of spreading the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith to the heathens. These missionaries request permission not only to preach, but to conduct mass conversions through coercive means.\n\nCompany ambassadors fear that such intolerance is very likely to provoke a reaction from the people of [company_missionary_province.GetName], and urge the Company to restrict missionary activity."
 investment_events.6.a: "[company_missionary_province.GetName] must follow the true faith."
 investment_events.6.b: "Tolerance is necessary to Company operations."
 investment_events.7.t: "[company_mint_province.TradeCompany.GetName] Coinage"
 investment_events.7.d: "Local merchants in [company_mint_province.GetName] have complained to the [company_mint_province.TradeCompany.GetName] about a lack of coinage stifling the flow of trade. The Company has been given permission by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to issue its own currency, allowing the foundation of mints in provinces under its control.\n\nMinting of course requires a supply of an appropriate metal. Gold, silver, and bronze are not always readily available to the Company. An alternative source of coinage would be to accumulate coins from [appropriated_currency_country.GetName] and countermark them with the Company stamp. This would likely anger the [appropriated_currency_country.Monarch.GetTitle] of [appropriated_currency_country.GetName], who would see this as a defacement of [appropriated_currency_country.Monarch.GetHerHis] image."
 investment_events.7.a: "Mint new coins in [company_mint_province.GetName]."
 investment_events.7.b: "Appropriate [appropriated_currency_country.GetAdjective] currency."
 investment_events.8.t: "Flourishing [Root.GetAdjective] Settlement"
 investment_events.8.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] settlers are thriving in [company_settlement.GetName]. They have established a small yet influential community, living largely apart from the [company_settlement.Culture.GetName] locals. In parts of [company_settlement.GetName], one might almost image they were walking the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] as [Root.GetAdjective] architecture and institutions dominate their cloistered districts.\n\nRepresentatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] community in [company_settlement.GetName] are seeking investment to further develop the province. Schools, hospitals, and places of worship are needed to accommodate the settlers."
 investment_events.8.a: "Grant money to build a holy place."
 investment_events.8.b: "Invest widely in the settlements."
 investment_events.9.t: "Rogue Traders Ignoring Company Monopoly"
 investment_events.9.d: "The [monopoly_ignored_province.TradeCompany.GetName] has been granted a monopoly on trade in [monopoly_ignored_province.GetTradeGoodsName] within its regional jurisdiction. Rogue traders are therefore a serious concern for the Company, as unlicensed traders threaten to undermine the monopoly through competition.\n\nSuch illicit dealings have become rife in [monopoly_ignored_province.GetName], where rogue traders are engaging in free trade with merchants from the neighboring state of [monopoly_ignored_country.GetName]. The Company wishes to crack down on this trade by either reminding the [monopoly_ignored_country.GetAdjective] traders that they are bound by treaty to respect the monopoly, or by prosecuting the rogue traders themselves, making an example of them in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 investment_events.9.a: "[monopoly_ignored_country.GetName] must trade only with the Company."
 investment_events.9.b: "We will prosecute the rogue traders ourselves."
 investment_events.10.t: "Company Interference in Local Conflicts"
 investment_events.10.d: "The [company_interference_province.TradeCompany.GetName] reports that its neighbor, the nation of [company_interference_country_1.GetName], has become embroiled in war. Company officers see opportunity in the crisis, seeking to advance the long-term interests of the company. Winning the affections of [company_interference_country_1.GetName] would facilitate the peaceful growth of our trade in the region. Supporting their enemies, the state of [company_interference_country_2.GetName], might weaken [company_interference_country_1.GetName] enough that they would be forced to accept more coercive treaties, or even be vulnerable to a Company invasion."
 investment_events.10.a: "Send support to [company_interference_country_1.GetName]."
 investment_events.10.b: "Send support to [company_interference_country_2.GetName]."
 investment_events.10.c: "Do not interfere."
 investment_events.11.t: "Support from [From.GetName]"

Whether Arabs, Turks, or Afghans, the Rajputs have historically resisted the rule of any would-be conquerors.\n\nThe power of the Rajput clans extends far beyond Rajasthan itself, occupying a privileged position throughout northern India. With the Rajput clans now at least nominally accepting our rule, we should consider their future in the [Root.Country.GetAdjective] nation.
