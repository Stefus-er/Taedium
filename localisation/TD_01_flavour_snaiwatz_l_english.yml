 snaiwatzer_organization_of_kriegskapitanate: "Organization of Kriegskapitänate"
 snaiwatzer_organization_of_kriegskapitanate_desc: "Most mercenaries in the saelian empire are either royal armies rented out by the Nahtrucer markgrafs or private armies of Snaiwatz. They were widely used since the 13th century as an alternative way of income for rural pastoralists of Cacumuds. They were hired not only by the small states in their regional conflicts, such as Geoberic princes and Salish princes, but also by bigger countries, such as Bohemia, Rubmeo and even Kriegersteiner emperors. They were known in these times for their discipline and effectiveness, often being smaller in numbers, but using more elaborate tactics and advanced technology, e. g. adopting gunpowder arquebuses earlier than any other part of the empire. Most of these mercenaries aren’t organized as free companies or independent armies, but are rather soldiers rented out by the local states. They are led by the Kriegskapitäns, meaning war captains, who is a representative of the duke or count in military affairs outside of the borders of the state. In the early times they were simply relatives of the ruler, but with time they shifted into a more meritocratic position."
