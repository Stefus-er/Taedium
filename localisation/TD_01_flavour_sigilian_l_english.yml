While this behaviour was mostly unharmful, recently he became a center of discussion due to his prepostrous claims about the nature of emperorship in our modern times.

 sigilian.2.desc:0 "Sigilian faith is a continent-spanning religion. Rites and traditions in Capira are much different than those in dorchean isles. More often than not, the priests take liberal approach to the official doctrines of the church to more easily relate to local populations, but this time it went so far, that the emperor himself demanded to stop those unregulated practices and stick to the universal theology. Our angered clergy quickly reuqested we do something about it."

 ## Argenteus Tax is Unpaid
 sigilian.4.t:0 "Argenteus Tax is Unpaid"
 sigilian.4.desc:0 "Argenteus Tax is the oldest and still collected tax in the saelian world. It was initially collected during the early days of the church to support building new temples and was paid exclusively in silver, thus the name. As the times progressed, the tax lost its importance and these days is just seen as a symbol of loyalty to the emperor and imperial cause. Now, our glorious nobles, decided to not pay it due to their prideful yet stupid nature. They are trying to explain their behaviour with 'bad economic situation' and 'peasants not working hard enough', but despite all of this, the clergy demands the tax to be paid. What shall we do?"
 sigilian.4.a:0 "Side with the nobility."
 sigilian.4.b:0 "Side with the emperor."
 sigilian.4.c:0 "Fine, I'll pay for them."

 sigilian.5.t:0 "Heathen influences"
 sigilian.5.desc:0 "Trading with the heathens has brought our nation a lot of prosperity - exotic goods, new ideas and overall increase in commerce. Nonetheless, the clergy fears that these non-believers might bring us more harm than good in the long term and requested that the court takes action and issue an embargo on all non-sigilian products."
 sigilian.5.a:0 "This is outragous - the trade must flow!"
 sigilian.5.b:0 "I demand higher toll for heathens!"
