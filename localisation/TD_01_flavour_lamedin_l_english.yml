 lamedin_teneran_slave_trade: "Teneran Slave Trade"
 lamedin_teneran_slave_trade_desc: "Slaves captured deep in Sahila often travel through Teneran trade routes to reach Arkabil and Visparaya, where they tirelessly work to their death. By owning large portions of northern Sahilan coast, we can ensure slave traders have to pass through our lands if they want to make any profit."
 lamedin_frontline_of_faiths: "Frontline of Faiths"
 lamedin_frontline_of_faiths_desc: "Lamedinian coast if where the two conflicting branches of Ilumism converge and intermingle. These clashing ideas were always a cause of conflict in the region, dividing it into Antawili and Muzbahi spheres of influence. These divisions can only end through victory of the obviously righteous belief over the treacherous one."
 lamedin_raqattraf_ships: "Raqattraf Ships"
 lamedin_raqattraf_ships_desc: "Raqattrafs are feared among many nations of the Maqitan, especially the Arkabili and Chilverchians. Their ability to extensively raid and then quickly disperse once the enemy fleet is noticed makes them great at bringing devastation to the coasts of our enemies."
 lamedin_mountainous_respite: "Mountainous Respite"
 lamedin_mountainous_respite_desc: "Mountain chain running across the coast often are high enough that in their upper parts climate is mild enough for people to thrive in. These communities are often remote enough that they are hard to reach for enemy armies and large enough that they cannot be simply ignored."
 lamedin_signaling_chains: "Signaling Chains"
 lamedin_signaling_chains_desc: "Despite being dominated by pirates, our coasts are filled with towers ready to shine distant lights, however their purpose is not to guide merchant ships, but to quickly notify the towns of emergencies or enemy fleets. This allows for much quicker organisation of war effort across the country and allowing our sailors to flee."
 lamedin_corsairs_for_hire: "Corsairs for Hire"
 lamedin_corsairs_for_hire_desc: "While for the most of history Lamedinian piracy was dominated by independent raiders and ravagers, more and more turn their eye to a more profitable bussiness - selling their services to their previous victims. Now instead of picking important coastal settlements, they are paid to attack merchant caravans, similar in tactis of how piracy was practiced in the eastern Maqitan."
 lamedin_ishab_raiders: "Ishab Raiders"
 lamedin_ishab_raiders_desc: "Despite having predominately maritime society, many of our people still travel by horses and camels, often leading pillaging on land rather than sea. One of those groups are Ishab raiders, who are known for their ability to outmanoeuvre the enemy and deal large amounts of damage to their troops before they can effectively react, tactics not so different from those used by our sailors. Their services were often used as an example by not only Lamedinian, but also Antawili troops."
