 synthetic_dawn.3.t: "Synthetic Dusk"
 synthetic_dawn.3.d: "The last of the Synthetics has been destroyed. Though much of the world now lies in ruin and countless people have lost their lives, the world is finally rid of them. Scavengers mill over their static husks searching for some clue as to how these murderous automatons were able to function and what drove them to invade our world. They find few answers. But perhaps some of the technology they left behind might be adapted to our own purposes."
