 liemarian.1.t:0 "The Liemarian Proclamation"
 liemarian.1.desc:0 "“The Era of Emperors must come to an end.\n\nThe true Vicarius is not one who panders to his own vanity, nor one who thrives on conflicts with neighbouring realms, nor is he chosen by four tainted tetrarchs. As the wise Liemar has said, it is the masses that possess the truest insight into the heart of a man touched by our god, the man chosen to be Episcopus Maximus.\n\nWhy must anyone suffer due to the hands of an impure man, who deceives us for his selfish power struggles against all that may defy him? The Saelian Empire has long been fractured by the failure of the Emperors, allowing war and famine to be rampant within his own lands. Our hearts know how we must move forward.\n\nLiemar has built on the reformatory work of many great men before him who have presented their grievances to the world against the false Vicarius. For too long have our ancestors been content to live in the shadow of corruption while light has been present to them for centuries. No man will ever use the mantle of Vicarius to forward his own gains ever again, for the community can discern the fruits of faith from the rot of fraud. Fiefdoms will fall. Nations will rise. United with faith against the tyranny of the false pretender.”\n\nExcerpt from “The End of an Era: Where Justice Prevails, 1639” - Frederic Conrad von Artausitz"

 liemarian.7.desc:1 "Sometimes, we have the chance to set something into motion without seeming to have done anything. One such chance has arrived recently, when a cardinal living in [send_cardinal_province.GetName] admitted to an agent from [Root.GetName] that he would consider moving across the border to [receive_cardinal_province.GetName] and support us in the Curia for a price. While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this: the wrath of [send_cardinal_province.Owner.GetUsableName], the country he'd be deserting."

This intentional sabotage of our influence in the Curia is unacceptable and will not stand unchallenged."
