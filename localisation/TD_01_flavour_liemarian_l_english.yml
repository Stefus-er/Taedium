 liemarian.1.t: "The Liemarian Proclamation"
 liemarian.1.desc: "“The Era of Emperors must come to an end.\n\nThe true Vicarius is not one who panders to his own vanity, nor one who thrives on conflicts with neighbouring realms, nor is he chosen by four tainted tetrarchs. As the wise Liemar has said, it is the masses that possess the truest insight into the heart of a man touched by our god, the man chosen to be Episcopus Maximus.\n\nWhy must anyone suffer due to the hands of an impure man, who deceives us for his selfish power struggles against all that may defy him? The Saelian Empire has long been fractured by the failure of the Emperors, allowing war and famine to be rampant within his own lands. Our hearts know how we must move forward.\n\nLiemar has built on the reformatory work of many great men before him who have presented their grievances to the world against the false Vicarius. For too long have our ancestors been content to live in the shadow of corruption while light has been present to them for centuries. No man will ever use the mantle of Vicarius to forward his own gains ever again, for the community can discern the fruits of faith from the rot of fraud. Fiefdoms will fall. Nations will rise. United with faith against the tyranny of the false pretender.”\n\nExcerpt from “The End of an Era: Where Justice Prevails, 1639” - Frederic Conrad von Artausitz"

 liemarian.3.b: "This will blow over"
 liemarian.4.t: "Council of Tiepol"
 liemarian.4.desc: "The Liemarian debates about doctrinal unity have reached a breaking point so much so that it results in fist fights between priests. This led to the annoucement of Council of Tiepol, where new Liemarian doctrines will be set once and for all. There are 2 major groupings - Cesaronians and Palmisanians. Palmisanians believe that the imperial system was only partially flawed and overall unity and power of the Vicarius, while Palmisanians want to give each nation higher degree of autonomy in their practices and doctrines."
 liemarian.4.a: "Let the Council commence."
 settle_the_doctrine_title: "Settle the Doctrines"

 liemarian.5.t: "The Wirosepan Resurgence"
 liemarian.5.desc: "The dying faith of Wirosepan was originally only slightly adapted version of standard Saelian theology, but it soon became a whole new system of beliefs. While popular during its introduction to the isles, thanks to the efforts of dorchean nobility it was replaced by imperial model. This did not however eradicate the religion and during the age of reformation it entered its second golden age of popularity, being practiced not only by rural peasants but also scholars and nobility."
 liemarian.5.a: "Interesting."
 liemarian.5.b: "Very, very interesting..."

 liemarian.7.t: "Cardinal Across the Border"
 liemarian.7.desc: "Sometimes, we have the chance to set something into motion without seeming to have done anything. One such chance has arrived recently, when a cardinal living in [send_cardinal_province.GetName] admitted to an agent from [Root.GetName] that he would consider moving across the border to [receive_cardinal_province.GetName] and support us in the Curia for a price. While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this: the wrath of [send_cardinal_province.Owner.GetUsableName], the country he'd be deserting."
 liemarian.7.a: "We will take our chances that they never find out."
 liemarian.7.b: "It is not worth risking, but the man who found him deserves a promotion."
 liemarian.8.t: "Cardinal Bribed to Move"
 liemarian.8.desc: "A cardinal who had previously stayed in [Root.GetName], close to the border, has now moved out of our nation entirely and shifted his allegiance to our neighbors. The [From.GetAdjective] agents who bribed him to betray us probably thought we would not notice their hand in the matter, but they were wrong. This intentional sabotage of our influence in the Curia is unacceptable and will not stand unchallenged."
 liemarian.8.a: "It is an affront to both us and our Church."

 liemarian.9.t: "The Episcopus found illegitimate!"
 liemarian.9.desc: "Many priests in the Episcopate have been concerned about results of recent election of [PAP.monarch.GetName] as the new Episcopus Maximus. He has been found to have strong connections with [Root.monarch.GetName]. When this information came to light, [PAP.monarch.GetName] quickly joined the episcopes, claiming that our king tried to bribe him and other priests during the election. His confession is clearly false, but most of the Liemarian community decided to side with this liar."
 liemarian.9.a: "These sigilian spies want to undermine our church's cohesion!"
 liemarian.9.b: "Even if they are not right, we should yield in to avoid another schism."
 liemarian.10.t: "The Flourishment of Religious Syncretism"
 liemarian.10.desc: "Religious syncretism with roots going as far as during the rule of Saelius, has been an important conversion tactic against even the staunchest heathens. Now, with much lighter and more free doctrines than ever, thanks to the abolition of Universalist approach, syncretism with local population is more apparent."
 liemarian.10.a: "Let it flourish further"
 liemarian.10.b: "Stop it! It's Heretical!"
 liemarian.11.t: "Cardinal opposes church doctrine unity"

 liemarian.13.desc: "Zealousness surrouding the rapid spread of Liemarianism across the Sigilian community has created a new generation of missionaries, willing to spread their views of the world to us. Some of those young men came to our lands to manifest their doctrines in towns and villages. Many worry about these activities and wish for us to take action."
 liemarian.13.a: "Support the missions"

 liemarian.18.desc: "After embracing the Liemarian doctrine, it has become obvious we can't be a part of the empire much longer due the religious barriers between us and our suzerain. We must finally accept our destiny."
 liemarian.18.a: "We must forge our path alone"
 liemarian.18.b: "We can't abandon the emperor."
