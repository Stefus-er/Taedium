 antawil_maqhazian_assimilation_desc: "Yermic colonizers attempted to settle in the land of our ancestors ever since their expulsion from their homeland. While our bretherens in the west fervently try to contain their expansions to this day, we decided many years ago that the best way to deal with them is to allow them into our borders for the price of accepting our customs and laws. Waves of settlers reached out kingdom, establishing many important cities and towns, slowly embracing our way of life, however the integration was not one-sided and we embraced their faith and many of the administrative and naval innovations."

 antawil_the_blue_haven_desc: "Talkimar, which means 'blue haven' in the Muzbahi language, is the most important city and port of the region thanks to the river Talkada, which not only nourishes our soils and crops, but also is an important trade route to the Azgur mountains, connecting the coast with the inland settlements.\n\nThis settlement is often shown as a perfect example of Maqhazian urban planning, characterized by orthogonal streets running along the cardinal directions with a marketplace at the crossroad and a port at one of the road's ending. This method prioritized economic growth, exchange of goods and a plan adaptable to most terrains. Talkimar also pioneered a new way of constructing dockyards, which allowed for much more efficient transport of goods, increasing their throughput."

 antawil_dafdan_wars_desc: "Unbroken zealots of Dafda always had a certain unified identity, which was preserved for generations to this day, which led to many invaders avoiding any attempts at conquest of Dafda, simply knowing that any occupation would quickly result in a bloody rebellion.\n\nThis, however, did not stop our even more ardent sailors from taking control of the 'crossroad island'. The series of four wars from the end of the fourteenth century after many struggles ended in our victory. The pivotal moment was the battle of Punmeridia in 1411, when agile Lamedinian ships were able to quickly capture Dafdan mercantile fleet, however they were quickly being destroyed by heavily armed Dafdan galleys. In the critical moment of the battle, Maqrin Outalli managed to surprise the Dafdan with heavy volleys of arrows from the Peninsul bowmen. This ultimately led to the shattering of enemy's forces and their utter defeat."

 antawil_ajnijmat_desc: "Our people have a long tradition of respecting every tribe's opinion in the matter of governing the nation. Braissli tribes united and democratically elect their leaders while developing kingdom of Usnal is embracing a feudal democracy. Despite the enroaching ideals of Yermic administration, the institution of Ajnijmat has remained almost unchangeably from centuries ago, being a pivot of an everchanging national identity.\n\nDecisions taken during the long deliberations of clan leaders, nobles, oligarchs and bekhers have a binding power on the ruler, who has no choice but to act on their wishes. Power of the estates was greatly diminished in the middle ages, but once again thanks to the expanding borders and influence of Antawil they are once again to be respected by the royalty."

While the capabilities of artillery in naval combat have been known some time in this part of the world, it was discovered by our innovative admirals that it is incredibely effective against Yermic settlements, which predominately consist of coastal towns protected by a nearby forts. Using the tactics of the legendary Maqrin Outalli and focus on achieving land domination through heavy maritime support allowed us to effectively conquer these strongholds from a relatively safe distance and then finish the remaining resistance by sending the land troops. Nowadays, our fleet dominates the not only the Alkalen, but the whole Maqitan sea."
 antawil_the_pact_of_gold: "The Pact of Gold"
 antawil_the_pact_of_gold_desc: "Historically lion's share of commerce of our merchants comes from the slave and ivory trade, purchased braissli and Parroutan merchants. However the ambitions to take a hold of the trade routes in Sahila has led to the Teneran tribes finally uniting and being the ones that de facto control the regional flow of goods. Our merchant class has devised a plan, in which Šarikullan merchants were able to keep trading in the south, however we were the only ones that are able to move the goods further north, to less saturated markets where Sahilan goods were seen as luxury. This led to the signing the Pact of Gold, creating a mutual economic, and later military, alliance between us and tribes of Šarikullu. This diumvirate not only prevented the fall of our economy, but quite the opposite - made us and our partner stronger."

Now Aqerbic and Chilverchian merchants are slowly establishing new outposts, trying to take hold of our markets to soothe their greed for valuable luxuries produced by hard-working people and purchase them at scandalous prices, threatening wars if the merchants don't comply.\n\nTyranny of the northeners has come to an end and it is us that will make sure that the citizens of our glorious nation can live in peace, without a threat of foreign exploitation. They will no longer see us as worse, because we will show them that we are the beacons of hope for all people of Sahila."
