He wrote about the history of the town of Arduacollum, the hometown of Saelius, which was later renamed to Seliana to commemorate the first Emperor. In one of the chapters of the chronicle Theodore in the beggining rejects his father's teachings and ambitions, only to later show remorse, for which his father awarded him the lands west of their hometown. After this change of heart he started to lead a lavish lifestyle, ignoring the needs of his people, which caused Saelius to once again disown Theodore. He is rarely mentioned due to his not-so-virtuous lifestyle and fickle story, but the author of the chronicle claims that Theodore had two sons, whose descendats will be of de Seliana dynasty.\n\nNow that the imperial crown is once again is worn by the descendants of the great Saelius, many hope that it will bring not only much needed stability, but also a new age of splendor to the Empire."
