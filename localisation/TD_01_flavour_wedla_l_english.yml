It quickly spread to courts of Narbona, Capiranella, Argenia and even the Saelian Empire, where it was seen as a luxurious drink elevating the status of the nobility even more above the typical peasant.\n\nThe best chocolate, however, is produced by us. Prince Karol Ethel, member of the [Root.Monarch.GetName] family, managed to attain great swats of land where he produces the famous Wedlan chocolate. The most popular version is sold with vanilla extract, but many prefer to drink it with honey, sugar and even paprika."

 wedla.3.desc: "City of Togawy historically has been a minor fishing village at the coast of Ostemer, but as the times went by more people were attracted to this city thanks to the abundance of Amber. Popularisation of amber-related goods in the southern markets increased the demand for it, which greatly helped Togawy to further grow - craftsmen and jewelers migrated to this city en masse in the following years. Up until recently Togawian amber jewelry was hard to come by, but now with the spread of manufactories the method of producing it become more and more sophisticated, bringing us even more prestige and splendor."
