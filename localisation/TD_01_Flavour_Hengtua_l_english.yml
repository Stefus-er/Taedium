 bulghaen_ox_king_palace_desc: "Once the Heisen Empire fell, the lands were in disarray, with new kings in the mainland grasping for control over the remnants. Poor and lacking many trade partners, the early kings of Bulghaen struggled to control the former colony and lacked much popular support. This changed with the reign of the Ox King, one said to be very tall with the physique of an ox that began many building projects on the fledgling kingdom.\n\nConstructing new ports, farms and his large palace near Heomdan in the Kwaashan Mountains, he was revered by both the courtiers and the populace, being an exemplar of the Hujiming school. A statue was erected after his death and placed in the centre of the palace courtyard with a depiction of large ox horns to illustrate his epithet."

 bulghaen_daisalam_colonization_desc: "To many, the coasts dominated by steep cliffs on eastern Moongma were seen as uninhabitable, due to the difficulty of traversal and no attempt of mapping. This changed with the Heisean Empire, as an attempt was started in 102 AI to establish a colony on the island chain south of the mainland. With a great knowledge of cartography from a land with similar geography, eastern Moongma was charted and soon populated with the people now known as the Daisalam."

Decorated with many flags, rooves and intricate designs based on legends about the Kwaazim Spirits, the seemingly floating temples are a marvel to witness.\n\nDue to the nature of their construction, only a low number were constructed, making pilgrimages on the island more distant than those in lands with plenty of shrines."
 shanshue_hot_spring_tradition: "Hot Spring Tradition"
 shanshue_hot_spring_tradition_desc: "Hidden away on mountain slopes and behind dense jungles lie scattered hot springs, often used by ducks and other animals to bathe in.

The ransacking however did not continue for long as the pirates misjudged the cleverness of the fishers. At night, the pirates left their ships lightly defended as they feasted upon their spoils on shore, believing to have profited greatly from a weak enemy. This left them wide open to be infiltrated by a hundred fishermen, who commandeered their vessels and armed themselves to retake their homes and rout the pirates. Ever since then, the shores were closely watched while fleets were made for the sole purpose to hunt pirate vessels, so that the mistake is never repeated again."

 rupaborsa_western_bastion_desc: "\"They call us forgotten, stranded, yet we stand as an unyielding bastion, sworn to hold the line where faith has been led astray. Still we endure, unmoved, unbowed.\"\n-Flameguard Rith Sokha.\n\nOur order has preserved much of the practices first shown to us long ago, often being scorned by the followers of Cách Mói as our attempts to spread the faith led us beyond the monastery walls.\n\nFear may strike the hearts of our faithful as they venture to hostile lands, yet the first missionaries too knew this fear, and their faith carried them through. It must be no different for us."
 rupaborsa_sacred_frontier: "Sacred Frontier"
 rupaborsa_sacred_frontier_desc: "In the many years of isolation, we have realised that a passive approach will not succeed if the Order is to survive. The stalwart opposition will not bend so easily to friendly missions in their villages, often baring its fangs at our followers when approached diplomatically.\n\nThis war cannot be fought with words and gestures alone, as forces gather on our borders, eager to finally remove the thorn from their side. We must grow beyond a simple thorn into a bramble too dense and defiant for any hand to uproot. Spear in hand, we embark for the sacred frontier, for we will no longer be halted by empty threats from a cowardly foe."
 rupaborsa_golden_glamour: "Golden Glamour"
 rupaborsa_golden_glamour_desc: "While the meagre farms and pastures of our lands allowed us to sustain our population, the lack of profitable goods led us to a struggling economy that couldn’t hope to compete with the great luxuries beyond the mountains and seas. However with the discovery of a great gold vein under Kanakadvar, a newfound wealth flowed into our coffers, giving hopes for a new age of prosperity.\n\nGolden statuettes, jewellery and currency flowed from the temples, funding new trade ventures that set many eyes on our order. Commissions grew as jewellers and smiths honed their skills, often sneaking in Xifang prayers engraved in the work, subtly growing our influence over the masses across the seas."
 rupaborsa_thorned_gates: "The Thorned Gates"
 rupaborsa_thorned_gates_desc: "Many would say that our lands are inhospitable, as tree roots tangle through the earth, restless shrubs growing wildly with no room for cultivation. Yet they do not understand how this land nurtures the lives of its inhabitants, protecting them from enemies too arrogant to look past its wild nature.\n\nSo too as the untamed thorn deters those that may seek its fruit, the thorned walls of Rupaborsa will deter those that seek harm upon its people. Utilising the same hostile nature that many refuse to tread on, the order can live on to times still untold, its strength rooted in the same wilderness others fear to claim."
 rupaborsa_bien_giura_struggle: "Bien Giura Struggle"
 rupaborsa_bien_giura_struggle_desc: "Leaving our isolationist ways brought us the foundation of our nation, yet upon adopting the Xifang faith, we became isolated in a new way, as we faced scorn from all sides. It is only past the Bien Giura that we may communicate with fellow faithful, in a sea full of dangers and potential enemies who do not appreciate a growing network of trade between heretics.\n\nIt is our utmost prerogative to preserve our presence on the seas, and by utilising the reliable wood and seaworthy men we can stand to contest the waters. Our sails will take us past any horizon, our cannons will ensure that we will do so with no harm."
 rupaborsa_aiding_the_thboira: "Aiding the Thboira"
 rupaborsa_aiding_the_thboira_desc: "The sparsely populated jungles of our side of the Bien Giura pale in comparison to the bustling fields and farmlands of Voitak, where cities sprawl from port to port. The lack of many resources to grow past small settlements and the isolationist policies of the northern states make it evident that the Thboiran people will be quickly eclipsed by eastern powers if we do not intervene.\n\nThese modest lands must flourish with our aid, propelling the Thboira to build cities that rival the rest of the world that once would have laughed at our plight. Let our support be the foundation upon which a new nation rises, one that no longer survives in the shadow of others, but stands proudly among them."
