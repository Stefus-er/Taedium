 ibliguz.1.desc:0 "The Reign of Gug Dagalk is seen by fellow tribesmen as the most tragic time in the histori of Ibliguz. Only recently we regained our independence from the Bunelisuli horde, but instead of rebuilding we are getting raided by our neighbours thanks to the lack of effort on the side of the Khan. Now a conspiracy is brewing to put an end to Gug."
 ibliguz.1.a:0 "Finally, we can rebuild."
 ibliguz.1.b:0 "It's so sad. Anyway, finally, we can rebuild."
 ibliguz.2.t:0 "The Rise of Gug"
 ibliguz.2.desc:0 "Somehow, the Gug has returned. His newly found confidence, skill and a handsome scar has allowed him to amass a great host of tribes and is now charging towards our capital to slay the false Khan and restore his place on the throne."

 ibliguz_assassination_of_gug_desc:0 "The vile Gug Dagalk nearly ran the state of Ibliguz into the ground with his incompetence, cowardice, and shameful impotence. Had his poor leadership continued, Ibliguz would have never been able to flourish and rebuild. Thankfully, under the wise council of the brave Bulat Güyçli, the cancer that called itself Gug was swiftly disposed of.\n\nAfter humbly accepting the title of Khan, Bulat Güyçli and his co-conspirators set to work righting the wrongs of Gug. His rule was a benevolent one, a far cry from the feeble excuse for a monarch that was his predecessor."

 ibliguz_legacy_of_gug_the_immortal_desc:0 ""Gug! Gug! Gug the Immortal!\nO blessed be his reign,\nFor his death he did feign.\nLike fire his rage did burn,\nAs we awaited his return.\nAnd as a man reborn he came,\nAll of the steppe his domain.\nGug! Gug! O Immortal Gug!"\n\n-Ibliguzi folk chant, author unknown\n\nGug Dagalk, later known as Gug the Immortal, was a pivotal figure in Ibliguzi history. Though the early years of his reign could be generously described as tumultuous at best, the attempt on his life by those he counted as trusted advisors made Gug a changed man. He is said to have vowed to let the scars he acquired that day forever remind him of his past failures, an oath he solemnly maintained after his triumphant return to the throne of Ibliguz. Though he could not prolong his rule unto eternity, the legacy of Gug remains immortal in the hearts of the Ibliguzi people."

 ibliguz_raiders_of_xawaran_desc:0 "The mighty fortifications that bar the lands of Xawaran and Samadia are but one legacy of Ibliguz. As a host of the fiercest raiders on the steppe, the horsemen of Ibliguz laid waste to the petty realms about them, pillaging and raiding to the point that their enemies felt it necessary to erect massive bulwarks in opposition."

 ibliguz_trade_with_hengtua_desc:0 "Some view Ibliguz is nothing more than a fearsome horde of roaming savages. While the ferocity of Ibliguzi warriors cannot be denied, that is no the sole defining feature of the Ibliguzi people. Ibliguz has historically profited greatly from trade flowing to and from Hentua--not by raiding any caravan in sight, but by safely conducting foreign merchants through Ibliguzi trading hubs in exchange for most reasonable and benevolent tariffs."
 ibliguz_kokesay:0 "Kökesay"
 ibliguz_kokesay_desc:0 "The Kökesay is a foundational epic, an epochal work of poetry detailing the birth of man and the rise of the Ibliguzi people. It is most notably centered around the tale of the forefather of the Anavats, an unnamed hero who was struck low by sickness or injury.\n\nIn this tale he was rescued by a she-wolf called Iblig, from whom Ibliguz derives its name, who brought him back from the brink of death and slowly nursed him back to health over the span of five months and five days. Once he had been restored to the height of his strength, the unnamed hero took the she-wolf Iblig as his consort, establishing the modern-day peoples of the steppe through their progeny."

 ibliguz_eastern_tanagan_holdouts_desc:0 "Tanagan is the fiercest and most overtly martial branch of the Merhaanic faith. It is their beleif that the great tree Merhaan bids them fightto prove themselves, for only through fighting can the most worthy truly be revealed. Though Tanagan may not be as widespread as it once was, its hold remains firm in Ibliguz."
 ibliguz_guznari_herders:0 "Guznari Herders"
 ibliguz_guznari_herders_desc:0 "Ibliguz is a state empowered by the varied groups that comprise the greater nation. Nowhere is this clearer than in the shepherds of the Guznari Plateau. The richness and quality of the wool they produce is unrivaled across Paqivaz, a fact that has garnered these humble nomads a great deal of respect for their craft. Even the Khans of Ibliguz wear Guznari wool."
 ibliguz_unifier_of_anavats:0 "Unifier of Anavats"
 ibliguz_unifier_of_anavats_desc:0 "Throughout history, the Anavatic peoples have ruled the steppe. Though they have oft operated as disparate nations, each fighting solely for their own survival, it is that very independence and fighting spirit that characterizes the Anavats.\n\nSince the birth of mankind by the great Merhaan the myriad Anavatic tribes and states have been destined to come together under one banner, united as one under the identity of the first men created on earth. Guided by this blinding truth, only Ibliguz is worthy of unifying the Anavats once and for all."
