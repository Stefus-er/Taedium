 ehsani_resurgence.1.desc:0 "For some time one name was on everyone's lips - Ehšan.

Many of our lords and scholars wish for this community to be eradicated, but there are individuals hoping that understading their beliefs might bring increased stability."

 rah_jadid.2.b:0 "Refuse to give money"
 rah_jadid.3.t:0 "Controversial Priest"
 rah_jadid.3.desc:0 "Many fail to find themselves in the dynamic religious landscape of Visparaya.
