 ideagroups.111.b: "Let us do what we can to realize these ideas!"
 army_professionalism_events.1.t: "Sack of [From.GetCapitalName]"
 army_professionalism_events.1.d: "Traditionally advancing armies have been expected to supply themselves from what they can plunder in the area they move through. This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."
 army_professionalism_events.1.a: "We must punish the perpetrators!"
 army_professionalism_events.1.b: "We need better payment routines and harder discipline!"
 army_professionalism_events.1.c: "Such are the rules of warfare."
 army_professionalism_events.2.t: "[Root.GetCapitalName] Looted!"
 army_professionalism_events.2.d: "Following the fall of [Root.GetCapitalName], the armies of [From.GetName] have devastated the city and the surrounding countryside."
 army_professionalism_events.2.a: "Barbarians!"
 army_professionalism_events.3.t: "The Sack of [Root.GetCapitalName]"
 army_professionalism_events.3.d: "As the city of [Root.GetCapitalName] fell into enemy hands, the advancing armies of [From.GetAdjective] embarked on several days of plundering. Inside the city walls a smoldering ruin is all that remains of the once thriving city and the survivors are seeking refuge as far away as they can."
 army_professionalism_events.3.a: "Our people will never forget the atrocities of [From.GetName]!"
 army_professionalism_events.4.t: "Delayed Salaries"
 army_professionalism_events.4.d: "The campaign in [enemy_country.GetName] has run into some severe logistical problems. As the season for salary payment draws nearer, it is becoming abundantly clear that we will not be able to pay all troops as there is simply no way for the money to get to them on time. Our generals blame constant enemy raids on the baggage train and insist they planned everything in detail, but the problem is now [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s to solve.\nIf we only pay a fraction of our troops many will no doubt desert.\nWe could also choose to pay none of them and tell them to live off the land, but that would likely devastate the entire area."
 army_professionalism_events.4.a: "We must pay the elite troops"
 army_professionalism_events.4.b: "Let them live off the land"
 army_professionalism_events.5.t: "The many jobs of a Soldier"
 army_professionalism_events.5.d: "Prolonged peacetime and changes in the economy has lead to many of our salaried soldiers no longer considering the pensions we pay them sufficient. An increasing number of them have turned to other daily work such as shop keeping or craftsmanship, earning a better living in their city homes.\nWhile this can stimulate the local economy it does mean that these troopers are no longer maintaining, or practicing with, the equipment we have provided them. In order to stop this trend, we would have to increase their pay substantially."
 army_professionalism_events.5.a: "They must not be allowed to do dabble in the roles other occupations."
 army_professionalism_events.5.b: "We will allow it for now."
 army_professionalism_events.6.t: "Foreign Talent"
 army_professionalism_events.6.d: "Our drillmasters stand in awe of the [professional_country.GetAdjective] armies and the methods they have so successfully employed to organize army routines and practices. We are not the only ones who have taken notice, [professional_country.GetAdjective] officers are in high demand in many countries. Of course the [professional_country.GetStateForm] of [professional_country.GetName] does not take kindly upon those of its officers that would seek employment abroad and would likely disapprove if we tried to entice any subject of theirs.\nThat does not mean, however, that there are not individuals who would be interested in such a career opportunity, if we made it worth their while."
 army_professionalism_events.6.a: "Hire [professional_country.GetAdjective] officers"
 army_professionalism_events.6.b: "Let us continue to rely on our own people."
 army_professionalism_events.7.t: "Infiltration of [From.GetName]"
 army_professionalism_events.7.d: "Our military professionalism has made our retired deserting officers very attractive to the other countries in the region. So much so that they are not properly vetting the defectors they recruit.\nOur spymaster reports that we have managed to get a number of agents into the service of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.GetStateForm]."
 army_professionalism_events.7.a: "Excellent..."
 army_professionalism_events.8.t: "Wargames"
 army_professionalism_events.8.d: "Our generals have asked us for funds to conduct a massive military field exercise to re-enact one of the great [Root.GetOldEra] battles. This would be quite costly, and take up a lot of their time, but they insist it would both provide valuable insights to them, be a good way to drill the troops and perhaps intimidate our neighbors as well."
 army_professionalism_events.8.a: "Allow them to re-enact the battle."
 army_professionalism_events.8.b: "We will soon give them a real war to try their theories in."
 army_professionalism_events.9.t: "Private Contractors"
 army_professionalism_events.9.d: "Due to lack of permanent structures many armies rely on private contractors to provide everything from equipment to entire regiments. Usually these entrepreneurs receive a sum in advance that they can then use to procure what the army needs on short notice. This often works well to meet the swiftly changing needs of our troops during campaigns, but there are those that would take advantage of the system.\nAs our armies in [enemy_country.GetName] advance deeper into enemy territory there are increasing reports of corruption and unwarranted cooperation between our logistical officers and local entrepreneurs. If we are to maintain efficiency we must root out these practices, but in the short run we will risk disrupting the system even more by fighting the corruption."
 army_professionalism_events.9.a: "Root out the rot!"
 army_professionalism_events.9.b: "We will have to let it be."
 army_professionalism_events.10.t: "An Army Career"
 army_professionalism_events.10.d: "With the growth of our professional army, new career opportunities abound for those with ability and ambition. The old [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments], however, still expect to be awarded all the most valuable commissions out of tradition and the centuries during which their lineages have served the [Root.GetStateForm] faithfully.\nSome of our higher officers are now imploring us to open more opportunities for able men to rise in the ranks, while others oppose this vehemently and maintain that there are qualities only blood can assure."
 army_professionalism_events.10.a: "We must safeguard the ancient traditions of our officer corps."
 army_professionalism_events.10.b: "We can make room for newcomers in the higher parts of the hierarchy."
 army_professionalism_events.11.t: "Esprit de Corps"
 army_professionalism_events.11.d: "The strain that the military lifestyle puts the men who serve under can, under good circumstances, lead to the development of a spirit of belonging and cooperation that greatly strengthens the armed forces. During the recent conflict with [enemy_country.GetName], we have seen clear signs that our troops are working better together, and that they have formed strong bonds of loyalty and duty to the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetStateForm] that would have seemed hard to imagine just a few years ago."
 army_professionalism_events.11.a: "This is what separates the [Root.GetAdjective] troops from all other."
 army_professionalism_events.12.t: "Lack of Officers"
 army_professionalism_events.12.d: "In order to keep a sizable professional army efficient, a sufficient number of trained officers are required to carry out the orders and will of the [Root.GetStateForm]. However, the increased demand on quality leadership is not matched by the number of officers on our rolls.\nWith increased demands on quality, new officers also take longer to train and are harder to recruit."
 army_professionalism_events.12.a: "Shorten the training."
 army_professionalism_events.12.b: "We shall overcome this in time."
 army_professionalism_events.13.t: "Local Militias"
 army_professionalism_events.13.d: "Many military duties are not performed by the professional armies of the [Root.GetStateForm] but rather by local militias based around the cities, castles and forts in the various parts of our country. These militias often know the local area well and provide very good value for money as garrisons, scouts and gatherers of intelligence but their quality as regular troops are very varied to say the least.\nIt has been suggested that we send professional soldiers to at least instruct all militias in the country and that we rely less on them when conducting operations in many areas. This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control. It would, however, also most likely mean dismissing a great number of our reserve troops."
 army_professionalism_events.13.a: "We need the militias."
 army_professionalism_events.13.b: "Let us not rely on local abilities."
 army_professionalism_events.14.t: "Fires of Industry"
 army_professionalism_events.14.d: "The growing needs of our professional army has had a profound effect on the local business in [Root.GetCapitalName]. The manufactories in and around the city can hardly keep up with rising demand and both investors and workers are now flocking from all over our country to [Root.GetName] to expand the business."
 army_professionalism_events.14.a: "The foundries of [Root.GetCapitalName] shall supply the nation!"
 army_professionalism_events.15.t: "Growth of Regimental Towns"
 army_professionalism_events.15.d: "As the army becomes a way to earn a livelihood for an increasing number of our subjects, the cities that house the army installations and barracks are starting to grow under the supervision of army engineers and renovators. In [Root.GetName] the growth of [Root.GetCapitalName] has come to benefit the entire province."
 army_professionalism_events.15.a: "Great."
 army_professionalism_events.16.t: "Treason against [Root.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry][Root.GetName]"
 army_professionalism_events.16.d: "Recruitment is out of necessity something that has to be a somewhat decentralized affair. Often it will be entrusted to [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] in the capital, and then they are responsible to turn up a set number of men in the various provinces under our control.\nThis is a system that to some extent relies on trust as the central government is not involved in the details of countryside mustering, and the only form of control we have are the, often sporadic, inspections the army itself conducts. One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal. The rolls we have for the area is full of fictional names and nobody seems to know what we could actually muster from the region."
 army_professionalism_events.16.a: "This is unfortunate."
 army_professionalism_events.16.b: "We must punish the perpetrator and conduct our own survey."
 army_professionalism_events.17.t: "Proliferation of the Musket"
 army_professionalism_events.17.d: "As firearms have grown commonplace our old regiments of elite troops no longer fills the same function as sharpshooters and pioneers. They have done much to develop our armies over time, and they will now be dispersed among our other regiments."
 army_professionalism_events.17.a: "Ok."
 hanafi_school: "Hanafi"
 hanafi_school_desc: "The Hanafi Madhab is named after Abu Hanifa No'man bin Tabet. The school originated in Kufa and is prominent throughout the Persian and Turkic world, including northern India. Though textual sources in the Quran and Hadiths are given preference, Hanafis have an inclusive view of sources and also employ analogy (Qiya), Istihsan and local customs (Urf) in their jurisprudence. Some view it as the most flexible of the schools."
 hanbali_school: "Hanbali"
 hanbali_school_desc: "The Hanbali Madhab is named after Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and champions withholding from any speculative theology, Kalam. Hanbalis maintain that the Quran and Sunnah are the only proper sources of jurisprudence and that they should be interpreted in a literal and traditionalist sense. Though it is accepted as a valid Madhab very few states actively promote the Hanbali school, and it was banned by the Abbasid Caliphs."
 maliki_school: "Maliki"
 maliki_school_desc: "The Maliki Madhab is named after Malik Ibn Anas and is prominent in particular throughout North Africa and Iberia. Jurisprudence is primarily based on the work and interpretations of ibn Anas and his student Sahnun as described in the al-Muwatta and the Mudawwanah. One of the foremost centers of learning within the Maliki School is the Great Mosque of Kairouan, near Tunis."
 shafii_school: "Shafi'i"
 shafii_school_desc: "The Shafi'i Madhab is named after Imam Al-Shafi'i, and it is prominent in particular among Muslims in Arabia, East Africa and East Asia. It was once the official doctrine of the Seljuk, Ayyubid and Mamluk Sultanates. Unlike other Madhabs the Shafi'i reject Istihsan Istislah as sources of Sharia, instead only relying on what is textually in the Quran or Hadiths."
 ismaili_school: "Ismaili"
 ismaili_school_desc: "Ismailism is named after Ismai'l ibn Jafar, the successor of Ja'far al-Sadiq, and was the dominant school of faith in the Fatimid Sultanate but has lost much ground since its fall. Ismailism encompasses a number of increasingly divergent branches, such as the Musta'li and the Nizari and in many ways they focus on the esoteric elements of Shiite faith more than the Jafaris or Zaidis."
 jafari_school: "Jafari"
 jafari_school_desc: "The Jafari Madhab is named after Jaf'ar al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam, and it's followers are 'Twelver' Shias. Twelvers believe that Ali, the successor of Muhammed, was followed by twelve infallible Imams chosen by divine decree. The last of the Imams, al-Mahdi, is expected to return as the savior of mankind, finally enforcing justice and peace in the world."
 zaidi_school: "Zaidi"
 zaidi_school_desc: "Zaidis are named after Zaid ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammed's son Ali, and follow his teachings as described in the Majmu' al-Fiqh. Zaidis emphasize justice and human responsibility and descend from those that supported Zaid's original revolt against the Ummayad Caliph. Zaidis entirely reject religious dissimulation as practiced by many Shias, and they are prominent in the Yemen highlands."

 muslim_school_events.1.t: "A Talented Judge"
 muslim_school_events.1.d: "Acquiring an education in theology and law is often a long process involving studying classical works of law, under the tutelage of the Shiekhs of various Madrasahs. For every work or commentary learned, the student acquires a certificate, an Ijaza. Depending on what Madrasha, and which Sheikh, the worth of the Ijaza may not necessarily be the same.\nA specific learned man has lately been making a very good impression in Madrasahs around the country, no doubt he has a great career as a Qadi or Mufti ahead of him."
 muslim_school_events.1.a: "I hear [mufti_province.GetAreaName] is in need of a new Qadi."
 muslim_school_events.1.b: "He will bring legal guidance to a generation as a Mufti in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 muslim_school_events.2.t: "The Sheik-ul-Islam"
 muslim_school_events.2.d: "Where the Qadis are the judges of the land, the Muftis are the ones to provide general legal interpretation and doctrine. A [Root.GovernmentName] as large as ours, however, needs an overarching authority over all Muftis. Traditionally this is the role of the Sheik-ul-Islam.\nThe Sheik-ul-Islam will not only author Fatwas himself, he will also be the one to appoint many of the regional Muftis in our realm, and ultimately he is the person who will safeguard the legality of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s edicts. Naturally the man we pick will belong to the [Root.GetReligiousSchool], but there are a number of distinguished candidates to choose from."
 muslim_school_events.2.a: "Let us elect the foremost and most loyal Mufti to this position"
 muslim_school_events.2.a.tt: "A loyal Sheik-ul-Islam will almost always take sides for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and will increase the chance of support from the religious establishment."

They have invited scholars not only from the wider [madrassah_province.GetAreaName] but also from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and even foreign theologians."
 muslim_school_events.3.a: "Wonderful."
 muslim_school_events.4.t: "Ghazis"
 muslim_school_events.4.d: "For centuries, wars to expand the faith has seen groups of 'Ghazis', or holy warriors on the frontiers of Islam, raiding enemy lands and bolstering the ranks of the faithful. Our war against the infidel [infidel.GetAdjective] has attracted the attention of such warriors. They have come to join our ranks to prove their worth as holy warriors, and perhaps for the promise of loot as well."
 muslim_school_events.4.a: "They are welcome."
 muslim_school_events.5.t: "Custodianship of [holy_city.GetCapitalName]"
 muslim_school_events.5.d: "With each year the holy city of [holy_city.GetCapitalName] has seen an increase in the number of pilgrims that seek the shrines there. The faithful come from all corners of the Islamic world, bringing commerce, goods, capital, news and ideas from faraway places to our ports."
 muslim_school_events.5.a: "God is Good."
 muslim_school_events.6.t: "Shiite Migration"
 muslim_school_events.6.d: "While Shiism is widespread in the Islamic world, most Shiites live in lands ruled by Sunni or even non-muslim states. In order to survive, our brothers of faith often have to adopt a policy of Taqiyya, deliberately pretending to distance themselves from the Shia faith. As one of few Shia [Root.GovernmentName]s we have come to attract members of faith who no longer want to live out their spiritual lives in secrecy. Many of them are both learned and productive members of society."
 muslim_school_events.6.a: "Let us welcome them into our cities."
 muslim_school_events.6.b: "Let us send them forth to populate the frontier."
 muslim_school_events.7.t: "Sufi Syncretism"
 muslim_school_events.7.d: "Sufis, with their mystical and less legalistic approach to Islam, are often more welcome among the heathen than the highly educated Ulema or soldiers of the faith. Manifesting piety in other ways such as dance, singing and by blending the Islamic traditions with local ones, the Sufis are not always at the best term with the religious establishment.\nA sufi leader has managed to get quite a following in [sufi_province.GetName], with a great number of [sufi_province.Religion.GetName] converts joining his disciples. His followers are clearing land for new settlements where they might live together and this could well lead to a much greater Islamic influence in the entire area. Many among the Ulema are asking that we send him on his way, as they fear he is leading the true faithful astray and blurring the line between Islam and the [sufi_province.Religion.GetName] faith."
 muslim_school_events.7.a: "He is doing God's work."
 muslim_school_events.7.b: "He will have to do his preaching elsewhere."
 muslim_school_events.8.t: "Foreign Theologians Enliven Scholarship"

 muslim_school_events.8.b: "They will find their places throughout our country."

 muslim_school_events.9.d: "By giving [scholar_country.GetAdjective] scholars in our Madrasahs we are not only improving the theological discussion in our country but also improving our ties with the [scholar_country.GetName] [scholar_country.GovernmentName]."
 muslim_school_events.9.a: "Excellent."
 muslim_school_events.10.t: "Religious Scholars Disagree"
 muslim_school_events.10.d: "Not all theologians agree. Normally this is not much of a problem, as disagreement can exist without problem in the scholarly world. Sometimes disagreements take on a more personal form however, some would argue that's how our invited scholars came to be at odds with much of our religious establishment, causing much harm to our international reputation."
 muslim_school_events.10.a: "Unfortunate."
 muslim_school_events.11.t: "Playing the Courts"
 muslim_school_events.11.d: "While the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school is the officially sanctioned school of the [Root.GovernmentName] there are many courts and Qadis throughout our lands and all four of the schools of faith are deemed appropriate for civil procedures. This means that to some extent it is possible to 'play the courts' by bringing a case before a Qadi of a school considered more likely to give a beneficial ruling to a specific case.\nAn entrepreneurial merchant in [shiites_here.GetCapitalName] has become so good at this that it has angered not only the local population and his business competitors, but also the local governor. There is not much we can do about this without making inroads into the privileges of the Ulema."
 muslim_school_events.11.a: "Let us just ensure that this man is dealt with."
 muslim_school_events.11.b: "Pragmatism must come before theology."
 muslim_school_events.12.t: "Taqiyya"
 muslim_school_events.12.d: "For centuries, many of the followers of Ali have considered it a necessity to hide themselves and feign adherence to other religious customs in order to keep their faith alive. Authorities in [shiites_here.GetName] have increasingly come to suspect that there is an increasing number of Shias among the local sufi lodges, and would like our blessing in their attempts to root them out."
 muslim_school_events.12.a: "We cannot tolerate heretics!"
 muslim_school_events.12.b: "We must respect the Sufi lodges."
 muslim_school_events.13.t: "Protests in [protest_province.GetName]"
 muslim_school_events.13.d: "As men of great spiritual strength, but also firmly part of the establishment, members of the Ulema sometimes choose to join social protests. A recent altercation between the local garrison and the urban population in [protest_province.GetName] have attracted the attention of prominent Mufti in the state of [protest_province.GetAreaName].\nOur local commander fears the situation might escalate unless we listen to the protesters, but doing so would come at a cost."
 muslim_school_events.13.a: "Let us compensate the people of [protest_province.GetName]."
 muslim_school_events.13.b: "Mufti or not, there is nothing we can do."
 muslim_school_events.14.t: "The poor of [urbanization_province.GetCapitalName]"
 muslim_school_events.14.d: "As cities grow, the old amenities and walls that once supported them decay. In [urbanization_province.GetCapitalName] this has over time led to change. Less clean workshops, such as those of tanners, have moved beyond the city walls, as have the cemeteries. Most visible, however, is the increasing number of poor in the streets. As existing charities have not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of the city, it has been suggested that we set aside more state property as Waqf, charitable donations for the upkeep of public soup kitchens and bath houses."
 muslim_school_events.14.a: "We will naturally support such a cause."
 muslim_school_events.14.b: "Surely local notables can afford charity out of their own pockets?"
 muslim_school_events.15.t: "The City of [holy_city.GetCapitalName]"
 muslim_school_events.15.d: "As Custodians of the holy mosques of [holy_city.GetCapitalName] we are responsible not only for the Holy Shrine. A state that claims this honor is also expected to fend for both the population of the holy cities, as well as the pilgrims they attract. For this purpose many rulers have devoted great resources, both within the cities themselves and large tracts of faraway farmland, in order to feed and maintain the area.\nSome say [Root.Monarch.GetName] has not been paying the attention to these cities that they deserve, that pilgrims are no longer safe and that there is great want in the streets of [holy_city.GetCapitalName]."
 muslim_school_events.15.a: "Let us set aside more land for their upkeep."
 muslim_school_events.15.b: "Sadly we have no more resources to spare right now."
 muslim_school_events.16.t: "Expansion of the [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] Madrasah"
 muslim_school_events.16.d: "The Madrasah of [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] has been gaining repute, not only as a center of [Root.GetReligiousSchool] learning, but also for its Shiekhs from other schools. [Root.GetReligiousScholars] scholars from other parts of the world have in particular made a name for themselves at the [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] Madrasah and as a result both the institution itself, the adjoining market district and the bustling city as a whole is growing rapidly.\nUrban growth is never without its problems, however, and a growing Madrasah still needs to be provided for. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] would set aside a larger charitable donation for the upkeep and maintenance of a greater Madrasah it would benefit both the city and the area at large."
 muslim_school_events.16.a: "We must contribute to this endeavor."
 muslim_school_events.16.b: "The locals can feed and pay for them."
 muslim_school_events.17.t: "Dargah"
 muslim_school_events.17.d: "A Sufi Sheikh has passed away in [dargah_province.GetName] and his followers are now putting up a shrine in his honor. Pilgrims from various parts of the country are already starting to come to the province to see the shrine of this great man, some calling him a saint. Local notables have set aside a charitable donation its maintenance and his former pupils have opened a lodge nearby.\nWhile there is nothing wrong with honoring a great man, some more traditionalist among the pious and the Ulema feel that this form or worship is sacrilegious.\n Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] pay the shrine in [dargah_province.GetName] a visit it might do much, both for the prestige of the shrine itself but also for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] popular perception."
 muslim_school_events.17.a: "Let us seek guidance at this holy place."
 muslim_school_events.17.b: "We must not feed into local superstition."
 muslim_school_events.18.t: "Alevis of [alevi_province.GetName]"
 muslim_school_events.18.d: "While they are not our direct brothers of faith, a great number among the Turkic tribesmen in Anatolia are Shia Alevis. Like the Jafari's the Alevis are twelvers and believe in the coming of the Twelve Imam. Their faith is also quite deeply entrenched in mysticism and Sufism. Under Sunni rule they have been forced to live a life in many ways secluded from society, they have not been allowed to intermarry the Sunnis and they have been distrusted by the state.\nMany among the people of [alevi_province.GetName] are Alevis, and they have generally welcomed us as their new overlords. Their mystical traditions are in many ways different from ours but if we embraced these people we could likely spread the Shia faith much more quickly in the area."
 muslim_school_events.18.a: "Let us empower our brothers of faith in the area."
 muslim_school_events.18.b: "While we welcome them, administration will remain in the hands of local authorities."
 muslim_school_events.19.t: "The Worldly Ulema"
 muslim_school_events.19.d: "Not all members of the Ulema are great theologians or intellectuals. Corruption can grow in any corner of the state and for some it can be hard to tell apart what benefits the faith and what might benefit themselves. It has come to the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetName] that a number of pious grants that exist around the empire have been obtained through fraud or illegally passed on to heirs. Our wazir has suggested that we inspect and verify all such grants in the [Root.GovernmentName], especially in regions that were not originally ruled by us.\nThis would clearly be a grave affront to the Ulema, however, who would see it as an encroachment on their privileges and an attack on their caste as a whole."
 muslim_school_events.19.a: "A few transgressions are nothing compared to what these men give us."
 muslim_school_events.19.b: "Only traitors have anything to fear."
 muslim_school_events.20.t: "The Maddhab of [Root.GetName]"
 muslim_school_events.20.d: "As a young country we are not yet patronizing any particular religious school. While there are many ways to follow God we should have a specific guiding doctrine for our rulers to follow."
 muslim_school_events.20.a: "Ok."
 muslim_school_events.20.b: "Let us follow the school of Abu Hanifa."
 muslim_school_events.20.c: "There is only the way of the Hanbalis."
 muslim_school_events.20.dd: "Malik ibn Anas has shown the right way."
 muslim_school_events.20.e: "Imam al-Shafi'i's teachings are the most relevant."
 muslim_school_events.20.f: "The Jafari school will last us until the arrival of the Madhi."
 muslim_school_events.20.g: "Ismail ibn Jafar and his followers will be our guides."
 muslim_school_events.20.h: "Let us never hide our principles! We must follow Zaid ibn Ali's teachings."
 muslim_school_events.21.t: "Neo Sufism & Traditionalist Reaction"
 muslim_school_events.21.d: "Many among the Ulema are increasingly unhappy with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Among pious Muslims, our inclusion of heathens in high offices as well as the adoption of heathen customs and traditions, is viewed with scorn. The intrusions of the state on interpretation of law and other traditional domains of the Ulema have also not earned the state any friends among the jurists of the realm.\nCharismatic Shiekhs of the Sufi Naqshbandi order have begun to agitate against the state what they consider a wrongful, and in some cases sinful implementation of Islamic law in our realm."
 muslim_school_events.21.a: "They are sadly misguided."
 muslim_school_events.21.a.tt: "From now on the religious establishment will react more strongly to impious conduct of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 muslim_school_events.21.a.ttb: "The §YUlema§! will now expect to be granted more land."
 muslim_school_events.22.t: "Wahabism"
 muslim_school_events.22.d: "A growing movement among the Hanbali Ulema of the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] is advocating a return to a purer faith. They strongly oppose any innovations to the prophets customs, and anything that is not part of the literary sources of Islamic Law. Strongly opposing all forms of Sufism, saint worship or Non-Islamic traditions they promise to bring a truer religious society to all who embrace their teachings."
 muslim_school_events.22.a: "Interesting."
 muslim_school_events.22.a.tt: "It is now possible for Tribal Federations to change school to Hanbali."
 muslim_school_events.23.t: "Sufi Shrines"
 muslim_school_events.23.d: "The practice to patronize or even provide for shrines connected to the tombs of famous Sufis has long been a major point of contention for the Ulema. With a more traditionalist generation taking power they are now placing pressure on our ruler to try to clamp down on this custom."

Lately, however, with the intensified activity of the [community_country.GovernmentName] of [community_country.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry] [community_country.GetName], the quarter has grown into a city of its own.\nThis is not without its problems, our own citizens are complaining that the [community_country.GetAdjective] community is growing at their expense.

All the important Mamluk households of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are calling upon their influence to have a say in who his successor is going to be. Depending on who wins our new ruler will have the support of different households and different parts of the country.\nOnly one thing is certain, those that would rather have seen their own group's interests prevailing will not greet our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with joy. Some might even spend the rest of their lives trying to limit his influence."

 mamluk_events.1.d: "While Mamluks make up the core of our forces not all of our military might consists of warrior slaves. Local [not_ruling_culture_province.Culture.GetName] soldiers make up much of our infantry and they are also used for guard and garrison duties.\nSmall chances of advancement and low pay aren't the best motivators however, and it is not clear how far we can trust these men. Certainly their training and equipment are often neglected by the Amir in charge of them.\nIn [not_ruling_culture_province.GetAreaName] the mistrust between the [not_ruling_culture_province.Culture.GetName] and Mamluk Amirs have led to a mutiny."
 mamluk_events.1.a: "We must crush this in its cradle!"

 mamluk_events.2.t: "The Tarh and the Royal Monopolies"
 mamluk_events.2.d: "Our predecessors have wisely used a system of royal monopolies to control the revenue from cash crops and fine goods. With demand falling however we are losing money on these investments. Our overseer in [monopoly_province.GetName] is reporting that they have been unable to sell their stock for two years now and worry that this is going to cost the state money.\nHe suggests that we force our subjects to buy these goods at a set price instead so that we can regain our investment. A process traditionally known as Tarh."
 mamluk_events.2.a: "What an excellent idea!"
 mamluk_events.2.b: "We will just have to endure the cost."

There are rumors of widespread support for his cause among the Mamluk households of the capital and even within the citadel itself."
 mamluk_events.3.a: "The penalty for treason is death!"
 mamluk_events.4.t: "Factionalism"
 mamluk_events.4.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is far from the only owner of Mamluks in our [Root.GovernmentName]. The households of influential manumitted Mamluks often contain great, if not greater, numbers of newly imported slaves from their home regions. These influential Amirs are often those with the greatest influence during a succession but even when the throne is occupied the influence of the Mamluk households are great on [Root.GetAdjective] politics. It is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to ensure that this factionalism does not stifle the politics of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."

 mamluk_events.5.b: "All men must die."
 mamluk_events.6.t: "The City of Cairo"
 mamluk_events.6.d: "Much older than our own [Root.GovernmentName], Cairo has been embellished by rulers and conquerors for hundreds if not a thousand years. Bringing order in this maze of buildings, from the tombs of the city of the dead and the slums of Fustat, to the bustling markets of Khan el-Khalili, or the great Citadel of Cairo itself, has proven a monumental task for many of our predecessors. Nonetheless, as the master of the city, [Root.Monarch.GetName], is expected to leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mark upon Cairo, both to embellish and develop it, and to combat disease and keep the order."

 mamluk_events.6.f: "There is not much we can do for the citizens of Cairo right now."
 mamluk_events.7.t: "A New Amir al-Hajj"
 mamluk_events.7.d: "The pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina is one that every Muslim should undertake at least once in their lifetime. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is our responsibility to ensure that they can safely reach that destination. This is a position that in many ways requires both cunning and martial ability, as the way to proceed can range from defeating raiders to negotiating passage from local rulers, to outright threats or bribery. The Amir al-Hajj will have the overall responsibility for the Hajj caravans and will have great freedom in how to achieve a steady and peaceful passage for all [Root.GetAdjective] pilgrims."
 mamluk_events.7.a: "Let us choose a Bedouin, the best of our own."
 mamluk_events.7.a.tt: "Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Bedouin Amir al-Hajj will be able to protect the caravans from dangers that none of the other options could."
 mamluk_events.7.b: "Let us choose a Bedouin, native to the deserts of Arabia."
 mamluk_events.7.c: "A skilled warrior will be up for the task."
 mamluk_events.7.c.tt: "Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Warrior Amir al-Hajj will have a good chance of defending the caravan if it is attacked, but he may also create unnecessary conflicts through his lack of tact."
 mamluk_events.7.dd: "An able diplomat will handle this best."
 mamluk_events.7.dd.tt: "Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Diplomat Amir al-Hajj will be more efficient when your country is at peace, and less so when you are at war."
 mamluk_events.7.e: "Only a loyal Mamluk can perform this task."
 mamluk_events.7.e.tt: "Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Mamluk Amir al-Hajj will be more trustworthy when your ruler has high legitimacy, and much less trustworthy when legitimacy is low."
 mamluk_events.8.t: "Hajj Caravans Raided"
 mamluk_events.8.d: "A recent caravan of pilgrims for the holy cities was ambushed and plundered. It is our duty to protect those among our subjects who would set out for the holy cities and now our ability to do so is put in question."
 mamluk_events.8.a: "This will not happen again."
 mamluk_events.8.b: "We must spend more to protect them."
 mamluk_events.8.c: "Our Amir al-Hajj will use his contacts to ensure a better outcome in the future."
 mamluk_events.9.t: "The Pilgrims are Safe"
 mamluk_events.9.d: "Our efforts to protect those of our subjects who seek to perform their pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have paid off. It is now long since there was last a raid and the realm is at peace."
 mamluk_events.9.a: "Excellent."
 mamluk_events.10.t: "Awlad al-nas"
 mamluk_events.10.d: "Having been educated to be loyal warriors since early age Mamluk slaves often have the complete trust of their owner or employer. Their sons however, the Awlad al-nas, having grown up under far more convenient and forgiving circumstances, are generally considered far less able and loyal. Unable to serve as Royal Mamluks the Awlad al-nas instead constitute a social elite within regular military units and in the lower administration.\nThese noble sons themselves are however continually trying to prove that they are ready for bigger responsibilities. With the open position of command for the defenses of the [defence_province.GetAreaName] state, a number of them are hoping that we will entrust them with this task."
 mamluk_events.10.a: "Let us appoint one of the sons."
 mamluk_events.10.b: "We can only trust our own, the commander must be a Mamluk."
 mamluk_events.11.t: "Qaranis"
 mamluk_events.11.d: "This [Root.GovernmentName] was founded by Mamluk slaves and the ownership and import of skilled warrior slaves remain the base for any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s power. It is only natural that a slave will be more loyal to his master than any other in his new homeland, and even more so if rewarded by manumission for services rendered.\nHowever, currently many of the royal Mamluks in our administration, court and armies are those that $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ bought and introduced to our [Root.GovernmentName]. These are men with great influence but no personal loyalties to [Root.Monarch.GetName], men that our new Mamluks accuse of plotting and trying to limit their influence."
 mamluk_events.11.a: "Let us root out the Qaranis from important positions!"
 mamluk_events.11.b: "We have no choice but to trust them, we are all Mamluks after all..."
 mamluk_events.12.t: "Furusiyya"
 mamluk_events.12.d: "The Furusiyya are a set of equestrian exercises that teach young warriors the craft of cavalry warfare. With detailed rules, training manuals and very popular public competitions and champions, the Furusiyya has in many ways been perfected by Mamluk warrior aristocracy. While some chroniclers would claim that the champions of today could never compete with the warriors of the past, it is still both customary, and very popular, for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s to arrange big public Furusiyya competitions, and the champions remain the heroes of many popular tales."
 mamluk_events.12.a: "This is good for the people, but not something for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to spend money on."
 mamluk_events.12.b: "Let us expand and build new hippodromes to patronize the flowers of chivalry."
