 khmer.1.t: "The Dark Age of Cambodia"
 khmer.1.d: "The once mighty Khmer Empire has fallen. Angkor, the very heart of Khmer civilization, lies ruined and abandoned after being devastatingly sacked by Thai invaders.

Pitakahara’s loyalty to the future Queen was great, and they devised a plan to escape back to Pegu together. Pitakahara is now the Queen’s closest advisor. As Shin Sawbu grows older she wishes to retire and live a life of spiritual devotion. She openly contemplates marrying Pitakahara to one of her daughters, granting him the title of Dhammazedi, and proclaiming him King of Pegu."
