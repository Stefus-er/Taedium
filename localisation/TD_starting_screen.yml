 CAP_desc_SS:0 "Capiranellan League is a diplomatic entity formed by desperate states of the eastern Camaria - Capira, Mazzardia, Tiarene and Acciarerto. League's goal - protect against the chilverchian marches and ultimately defeat them and return status quo to the region. This, however, might not be the easiest task - internal instability caused by each nation's desire to gain something from the alliance threatens the integrity of the pact. The league is doomed to fall - inaction with let eneratians win and victory will defeat purpose of the league. Or is there a way to save it and bring real camarian unity?"
