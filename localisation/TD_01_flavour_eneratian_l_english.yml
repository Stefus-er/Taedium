 eneratia_true_heirs_of_sal_desc: "Salius invisioned his succession as by blood first and by election second. The oldest son of the ruler was designated to inherit the Empire and in the case of a lack of a suitable heir, the next emperor would be chosen by the four tetrachs. This system is only effective at a glance, because only after 3 generations of emperors there was a conflict between Sigilius, who was backed by the tetrarchy, and Eneratius, who was a bastard, but still the eldest son, of the late emperor Ambrosius. People knew that the power hungry Sigilius was not connected by blood to Sal and bribed the electors to reach the crown, and thus many of the righteous nobles joined our side in the I Saelian Civil War. Ever since that moment, the empire has been split along the Dutissimani Range, separating the righteous from the wicked."
 eneratia_legend_of_calidan_pass: "Legend of the Calidan Pass"
 eneratia_legend_of_calidan_pass_desc: "When Eneratus declared his righteous war for the throne of the Saelian Empire, many thought he would be quickly defeated due to the low development and population of lands he controlled. For the majority of the war Eneratian forces had to be on the defensive, but even the emperor himself knew that they need to act fast. When the legion of Eneratus was caught in the mountain pass near the town of Anuevu, Sigilianists expected their enemies to be quickly crushed, but thanks to the ingenious use of cavalry, help from the local population and expert manouvering, the battle of Calidan Pass came to be remembered as a staggering Eneratian victory."
 eneratian_splendor_of_olaix: "Splendor of Olaix"
 eneratian_splendor_of_olaix_desc: "Through the history of our eternal empire, there were 4 cities widely associated with the imperial splendor. The seat of Eneratius was in the castle of Dauntere, lying on the east bank of the river Envase. After his death the court was moved by his grandson to the town of Monne, but a few years later it was changed again to the coastal town of Requpolis due to its growing importance and easily defendable position. It was the center of imperial politics and diplomacy for 200 years, until the great emperor Marcus the Great founded the castle and town of Olaix to further solidify his power. Olaix itself was a symbol of imperial power, splendor and influence over the Panourgian sea. The Chapel was a mix of Zakarturi and Capirian architecture and the castle used eastern innovations to make it not only exceptionally defendable, but also famous throughout the Maqitan Sea."
 eneratia_dutissiman_fortitude: "Dutissimani Fortitude"
 eneratia_dutissiman_fortitude_desc: "The border between the western and the eastern Saelianism was always designated by the Dutissiman Mountains. They always protected us against the Sigilians trying to 'reunite' the empire, stopping them even before reaching our prosperous heartland. To reinforce their defensive capabilities even more, many emperors, such as Alcaeus or Leontius, built extensive networks of fortifications and watchtowers, which were so effective their system was later used to protect the Confinian, Pamkusean and Zakarturi borders during the late empire. Despite them being deprecate after hundreds of years of siege development, the idea prevailed in our minds, helping us construct much more efficient fortifications, built in a strategically chosen locations."
 eneratia_prosperity_of_panourgia: "Prosperity of Panourgia"
 eneratia_prosperity_of_panourgia_desc: "The vast majority of people live in the basins of great rivers. Valleys of Magreina, Patromnis and Kidinare are one of the most prosperous lands known to man. Due to this, many people overlook how densely populated the coast of the Panourgian sea actually is. Pamkusean Archipelago provides plentiful of fish while Chilverchian heartland is covered in farmlands and vineyards - both of these factors were greatly beneficial to our prosperity and allowed us to become much more self-reliant in terms of food production."
 eneratia_conversion_of_pamkusea: "Zealots of Pamkusea"
 eneratia_conversion_of_pamkusea_desc: "Compared to places like Zakarturia or south Chilverchia, the people of Pamkusean Peninsula were eager to convert to our religion. The first to convert were the merchants who often visited our ports, exchanging ideas between the two regions and bringing our righteous religion to their homeland. Things quickly escalated after most of the city-states were vassalized during the height of the empire. Local leaders wanted to keep good relations with the emperor and thus many of them converted for their own personal benefit. One of the most famous stories of conversion is the tale of the Agkasian Autocrat Nikodas. After his son fell ill, he vowed that if the emperor can heal his son, he will become his most loyal servant. Days later, the son was miraculously healed and Nikodas became known as 'the Zealot'."
 eneratia_empire_of_the_east: "Empire of the East"
 eneratia_empire_of_the_east_desc: "Throughout ages, there were many great kingdoms around the Panourgian Sea. Pamkusean colonists dominated the sea, up until their own settlements rebelled against them. Zakarturi Empire quickly rose to power, dominating the Kakigia for centuries, but despite this they slowly decayed and fell to the Sasemite and Bunelisuli Hordes. Visparayan Empire was thought to be endless, but it has completely collapsed and returned to glory countless times, losing some of its splendor each time. Varazahan Empire tried to establish their dominance over the region, ensuring no nation would rebel against them, only to collapse after one successfull assassination. Only our empire managed to survive. The state might have fallen, but the ideas, the culture and the one true religion kept the dream alive. Eneratian Empire is the sole claimant to be the greatest empire of the Maqitan Sea."
