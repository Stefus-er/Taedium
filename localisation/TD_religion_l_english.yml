 sigilian_religion_desc: "Sigilianism is the dominant branch of the Saelian church. The secular and religious rule over the world is granted to the Emperor by the God. Emperors are elected for life by the Tetrarchy. According to the official doctrine of the Saelian Church, every country following the true faith serves and follows the will of the Emperor, however in modern times this is only nominal. \n\nJust as Eneratianism, in early days it heavily relied syncretism with local folklores, while still maintaining monotheistic worldview. In 1444 these differences aren't as clear but the influence of local culture still can be seen in regional rites and traditions."

 eneratian: "Eneratian"
 eneratian_religion_desc: "Eneratianism is the second biggest branch of the Saelian church.

After the Eneratian male line became extinct, the church was split between different bishops and turned autocephalous in this process. \n\nJust as Sigilianism, in early days it heavily relied on syncretism with local folklores, while still maintaining a monotheistic worldview. In 1444 these differences aren't as clear but the influence of local cultures can still be seen in regional rites and traditions."

In the end entire movement decided to leave Liemarianism and spread their faith themselves. Since then movement radicalised into believing that only Sal and his legitimate could function as religious icons, with some believing that it is only Sal that could represent God."
