 sigilian_religion_desc:0 "Sigilianism is the dominant branch of the Saelian church. The secular and religious rule over the world is granted to the Emperor by the God. Emperors are elected for life by the Tetrarchy. According to the official doctrine of the Saelian Church, every country following the true faith serves and follows the will of the Emperor, however in modern times this is only nominal. \n\nJust as Eneratianism, in early days it heavily relied syncretism with local folklores, while still maintaining monotheistic worldview. In 1444 these differences aren't as clear but the influence of local culture still can be seen in regional rites and traditions."

 eneratian:0 "Eneratian"
 eneratian_religion_desc:0 "Eneratianism is the second biggest branch of the Saelian church. It was created during the II century civil war in Saelian faith in which Sigilius in the west and Eneratus in the east both fought for the emperorship. Supporters of Eneratus rejected the idea of tetrarchy and adopted patrimonial doctrine of power. After Eneratian male line became extinct, the church was split between different bishops and became Autokefalic in this process. \n\nJust as Sigilianism, in early days it heavily relied syncretism with local folklores, while still maintaining monotheistic worldview. In 1444 these differences aren't as clear but the influence of local culture still can be seen in regional rites and traditions."

 saelian_ehrenic_pantheon_religion_desc:0 "Ehren Saelianism is a mixture between old Ehren beliefs and Sigilian doctrines. It was created when a desperate missionaries presented old Ehren gods as more noble and exalted than others in attempt to convert these lands. At first this movement was treated as a very radical particualist faction within Sigilianism, later it changed with Ehren Saelianism being treated as a seperate religion. This caused creation of different faction to appear and fight over its future. Sigilianist faction want to return to its Sigilian route, Ehrenist faction try to increase Ehren influence on its traditions, Moderates are strong supporters of remaining current structure and doctrines of the Ehren Saelianism and continuing to exist as one of Saelianist branches."

 agellidian:0 "Agellidian"
 agellidian_religion_desc:0 "Idea of this faith was sparked by 15th century Altaciman poet and philosopher Ali Ibn Sumayya Agellid Al-Altaqadim who proposed that the Emperor Saelius was one of the Yaltazim prophets and his word should be treated as such. This belief became especially popular amongst the urban population in Novoregno between XVI and XVII centuries and, with the growing influence of Liemarianism, became state religilon."

 wirosepan:0 "Wirosepan"
 wirosepan_religion_desc:0 "When the Saelian missionaries reached the Dorchean isles they had to take a new approach to their mission. They presented the Emperor Saelius as a god-like and omnipotent figure of a brave warrior seeking to establish his realm on earth. This idea quickly spread  even without the need of missionaries, but some time after the popularization of Universalist ideals in the isles it became a dying faith with little prospect of survival - unless someone shook the very foundation of Saelian church."
