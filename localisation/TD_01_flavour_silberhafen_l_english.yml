 silberhafen_ehren_shipbuilding_desc:0 "As a nation that was created by Ehren immigrants we still possess some of their naval prowess, and techniques. Because of it our production of ships can be cheaper than normal. We can't match Ehren numbers of ships but we can at least make them cheaply."

 silberhafen_foreign_legions_desc:0 "Size of Ehren population in our lands makes fielding armies much harder, even after integration of local cultures problems of manpower shortages appeared. We couldn't have as much troops as other countries on the field. This changed after foreign legions were created, a lot of people from outside the isles started to volunteer to them, joining them gives lessons of Ehren culture and languages to outsiders.
