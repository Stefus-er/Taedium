After some time many wished to expand on this natural occurence, trying to bring the water to places further from the river itself, where climate wasn't as suitable.\n\nNew canals were systematically build, with newer ones always being more advanced and effective than the previous iterations. Biggest increase in their number came during the golden age of Zawarmahzian dominance, when Alvas the Engineer unified the entire canal infrastructure of the region."

 nahshaharos_westward_expeditions_desc: "During the zenith of Kalmaqan, many looked for a way to expand their influence beyond conquests of eastern lands of Saelians and Ilumists. Rumors of an eastward route to Pemenia which avoided territories controlled by our enemies led to Kalmaqan Eshmudan 'Geba' to fund a great expedition of twenty four ships, each built from the strongest Alvarian oaks, able to withstand even strongest winds and storms. Despite this, the expedition never returned, many wondering whether they were killed by natives or they found a new life across the ocean.\n\nCenturies after the first expedition, an increasing number of merchants, captains and scholars wish to get funding for a tracherous new expedition across the sea, claiming that the seafearing technology has greatly improved since.

During his time as a tepan he greatly increased the influence of his city over neighboring lands and even unifying them in his later days, creating the first great empire of Aqerb, with the borders reaching as far as ancient Rouvia, establishing many new cities, spreading the faith to the newly conquered people. He was the one that brought strength and prestige to the title of Tepan, elevating it to a status not so different of an eastern king, but despite this, after years of fullfulling his ambitions, he retired to give power to a new generation of people, being a leading example of a self-limiting autocrat.\n\nMany people of Nahshaharos can claim their descend from Meqim and even those who don't still call themselves the people of Meqim, for he was the one that truly showed the light to Yermics of Aqerb."

 nahshaharos_yekhen_of_all_people_desc: "The tradition of bringing together the most influential and wisest people of the land originates from a need to effectively organize a colony where the interest of all peoples are respected to prevent unnecesary conflict. Yekhens were originally the dominant force in our cities until the time of Meqim, however assembly still was a counterweight to the power of tepans, sometimes even managing to force tepans to relinquish their power. Rise of estate monarchy in the east returned some of the strength to the Yekhen, however only in sixteenth century, under the reign of the weak tepan Kiman it was drastically expanded, to not only include landowners, merchants and some of the clergy, but also commonfolk, industrialists, pastorialists, colonists and military cadre.="

Before its foundation the studies were organized in the palaces of local sponsors of art and science. Greatest mathematical and philosophical minds of our times have studied and taught there, bringing innovation not only to ourselves, but to the entire world.

Sadly, disunity of the states in periods betwee the great empires always brought a new invader wanting to expand their influence. Knowing the fate of the peninsula in a case of ambivalence, Ahzai Mahtanban marched through Ifritica in 1441. He didn't stop there - later he threatened the tepan of Dushmira to bow down to Nahshaharos. The necessary evil of Ahzai allowed the Yaltazim populace of Aqerb to prevail and defeat the Narbonese forces in the battle of Rizqal, often seen as the first step to their collapse."

He is known for his dedication to conversion of the native population - so much so that he died during an attempt to convert the people of Matyan, however only part of his body recovered was the head.\n\nDespite the cruel death, his efforts weren't in vain, as many natives embraced the new ways as their own thanks to the schools founded and treatises written by Laven."

Waging war with fervent zeal, the knights knew little more than the taste of hot sand mixed with blood on the battlefield as they and their children stood to claim every inch of ground they fought for.\n\nAs the Marches were dismantled, they needed to be appeased, putting the Frontier Settlement Act in place to settle the veterans and their families into the fortresses, refurbishing them to create flourishing cities.
