 silvestrine.5.t: "Upper Magreina floodings"
 silvestrine.5.desc: "For centuries there were certain places along the river Magreina which were known for periodic floodings and had generally soft soil, which is avoided during construction. However the recent urbanization efforts and have led to many people forced to settle in these areas, to work the land and build new villages, dangerously near the flood terrace. While miry earth is enough of an issue, the year [GetYear] brough the biggest flood of the millenium, causing widespread devastation, taking whole villages down with the stream of the river. Many are now left without homes or a way to sustain themselves, and local princes are seeking salvation for their subjects."

 silvestrine.6.t: "Lichterian Uprising"
 silvestrine.6.desc: "Princes and dukes of Lichter always took pride of being the cultural overlords of the middle Magreina. They quickly consolidated the region while it was still considered to be imperial borderlands and held important position in the empire for centuries. Their downfall started with the royal marriage between von Kriegersteins an Scâffurts, ultimately leading to Heinrich IV inheriting both of their duchies. Now they demand more freedoms like they had in the good old days, wishing to once again extert their splendor over the region."

 silvestrine.7.t: "Pemenienzimmer"
 silvestrine.7.desc: "The fascination with the orient was always great in the Saelian circles, and often more distant lands were seen as more splendorous and fantastical. With the reconnection of Mysentria to the rest of the world, many now start to import goods across the Pisachaian Ocean, in order to decorate their palaces with exotic material such as porcelain, tapestry and calligraphy. Some members of our court have proposed to redecorate one of the royal palace's chamber in a more eastern style."

 silvestrine.8.t: "Albrecht 'Würfelwerfer' von Schlaufberg"
 silvestrine.8.desc: "The recent history of the Saelian Empire didnt' see many powerful emperors, and especially not that influential as Albrecht von Schlaufberg, also known in many places as Albrecht 'the Dice Thrower', or Albrecht 'the Brute' by his enemies, trying to undermine his unending patronage of arts.\n\nHe earned the title of würfelwerfer by often placing his own wellbeing and wealth on the scales, risking their loss in order to ensure the continuation of the imperial ideas across the continent. His tactical mind allowed him to quickly defeat the Lichterian uprising and His diplomatic eloquency helped to establish a lasting peace with the tetrarchy. His deeds also include establishment of permanent diet and strenghtening the royal authority in the rural areas, which were mostly governed by independent nobles.\n\nMany are certain, that if not for him, the empire's lifespan would have been shorter by not only decades, but by centuries."
