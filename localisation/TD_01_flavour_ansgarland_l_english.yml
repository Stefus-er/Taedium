 ansgarland_ansgars_legacy_desc: "When Ansgar Lauban ascended to the throne of Sylvenmark, he saw an incredible potential in the lands from which his march protected the empire. After some years of gathering intel about the enemy and resources from the current emperor, he set out on a twenty-year campaign, with the goal of defeating the Glaser heathens and establishing a new kingdom. Knowing that the Callainians are a populous nation, he embraced a more diplomatic approach, turning local nobles agaisnt their overlords with the promises of titles and power, at the cost of embracing the Silvestrine language and customs. Despite the kingdom falling apart after a century, its legacy lived on, with the elites keeping the new, Saelian way of life."

 ansgarland_resurgent_kingdom_desc: "Kingdom of Ansgarland was mostly in a distant memories of many people, however the great Geoberic houses of Lauban-Dovenrei and Lauban-Angelsei still remember their forefathers, often fighting over the claims to the crown."
 ansgarland_a_new_march: "A New March"
 ansgarland_a_new_march_desc: "With the assimilation of Callainians, it was assumed that westward expansion of the empire has ended, however a new frontier opened. While it is much more distant, the motivation to expand there is the same as it was centuries ago. Our expertize in establishing new fortified settlements, as it was done during the first kingdom, is still helpful to this day, allowing our people to securely expand without a threat of a raid. Even many method to integrate the natives still work, often leading to beneficial trading and diplomacy."
 ansgarland_kings_will: "King's Will"
 ansgarland_kings_will_desc: "During his time as a Markgraf, Ansgar enjoyed a lot of personal freedom thanks to the autonomy coming with this title. His authority was often protected by the emperor, making any opposition from the nobility almost nonexistent. After he unified his realm, he lost some of the emperor's grace, but now gained a loyal and local elite, which allowed him to further strengthen the crown. This authority remained through the divison of the kingdom, with the early modern age bringing a new loyal elite - the burghers and manufactory owners, which often worked with the ruling monarch to incrase their own power, at the cost of the old nobility."
 ansgarland_konigsgarde: "Königsgarde"
 ansgarland_konigsgarde_desc: "The king's guard originally was a group of soldiers managed by nobles with the title of Königsmarschall, granted to head of the dynasty most faithful to the monarch. The first house to gain this title was house Braung, known for their bravery against the Callainian forces. Their duties often consisted of keeping peace in the countryside and organizing the levies, but during the dusk of the kingdom, they used their influence to carve some land for themselves, betraying the kingdom for their own personal gain.\n\nAt first during the restoration of the kingdom the institution was abandoned, in later decades it was reinstated in a radically reformed version, while keeping the original ideals. Now, Königsgarde mostly referse to the military of the kingdom as a whole, but nobles still are granted the title of Königsmarschall. Now they aren't able to hold any landed titles and their role mostly focused on war leadership, controlling conscription and internal security. Compared to the old system, their ambitions are being kept in check thanks to the king's ability to seize all assets of marshall's family in case of a proven treason."
 ansgarland_garnimperium: "Garnimperium"
 ansgarland_garnimperium_desc: "Wool clothing and textiels were the primary export of our people for majority of the history, being valued for their high quantity and relative affordability. With the new privileges to the burghers, the cooling of the climate and increasing prices of furs, many started to expand the textile industry to accomodate the growing demand in the continent.\n\nWhile this brought wealth to our kingdom, true fortune came from the plantations in the new world, where vast areas of land were covered in cotton. Much more comfortable than wool, it was also cheaper to produce and was relatively unknown in Mysentria. This gave us a window of monopoly on cotton textiles in the continent, which exploded the development of new urban centers in the kingdom. The motivation to keep being the leading producer caused the new methods of production to be embraced. Many also began to barter in the Pemenia to keep the competition away and maintain our control over the textile market in the west."
 ansgarland_koniginsmarine: "Königinsmarine"
 ansgarland_koniginsmarine_desc: "For the most of Geoberic princes and even the kingdom due to our location at the edge of the ocean, a navy was only a way to effectively transfer soldiers, a simple tool to use when a need arises. With the age of oversea colonization, demand for a large fleet grew thanks to the expansion of transcontinental trade routes and a need to keep them at bay. In many cases it could also be used to project our own power on weaker nations, exterting influence to reach a satisfying for us outcome.\n\nThe first person to take special interest in the expansion of said fleet was queen Mathilda, which was also the founder of the naval academy of Hescerport. To honor her efforts, instead of dedicating the navy to the king like with the land army, it was named after the queens of Ansgarland, with the navy bearing the name Königinsmarine."

 ansgarland.1.t: "Ties of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty"
 ansgarland.1.desc: "The Geoberic dynasties are knit tighter than any other families. Thanks to keeping blood within the elite, there is always a high chance to find an alternative heir to the throne in case of the inability of our ruler to produce an offspring. Exactly in this situation the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] has found itself in, with some suggesting that the heir to the [geoberic_heir_source_et.GovernmentName] of [geoberic_heir_source_et.GetName] would be the ruler of both crowns."
 ansgarland.1.a: "We will trust [geoberic_heir_source_et.GetName]"
 ansgarland.1.a_tt: "We will fall under a Personal Union with the specified Country."
 ansgarland.1.b: "I'm sure one of my cousins will be a great heir..."
 ansgarland.1.c: "I WILL produce an heir, I promise."
 ansgarland.2.t: "Devil's Due"
 ansgarland.2.desc: "With the death of our widely beloved, yet not so competent in bed, ruler, the throne has finally been inherited by [geoberic_heir_source_et.Monarch.GetName]. Maybe thanks to this our nations will be able to be stronger - or fall together."
