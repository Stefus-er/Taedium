With the rise of Bunelisuli Empire, we were forced to resettle south and conquer the Paqivaz. While many died and many benefited from these events, most are almost certain that our wandering has come to an end. New, syncretic system of government is slowly emerging in more urbanized and enlightened societies and a new age for our people is coming."

Almost any good travelling through these lands had to come through this settlement because of its access to fresh water, strategic position and localization next to the lake Wadibax. While it was razed during the Bunelisuli reign, in recent years it started to return to its glory and many new structures were build such as Kausali and Merhaanic temples, trade depots and a new town hall in Hestani style."

 anavastan_kausali_rebirth_desc: "Kausali religion was here even before us, but this didn't stop our people from embracing many of its practices. Many even began to abandon their belief in Merhaan and accept that there is only one true Kausali god.

However in our case, most of our lands are surrounded by mountains, deserts and a body of water, which makes for a perfect natural defense. However in some situations, even this isn't enough and we had to embrace the Paredeshians style of fortifications, the same type that our brave warrios managed to broke through. To prevent this from happening again, they were adapted to be more resistant to artillery fire and bombardments."

This tradition was passed down generations up until this day, which in a world of increasingly professional armies is a very handful cultural pillar. Only the most disciplined and experienced soldiers are set to survive the war and help us dominate in the modern world."
