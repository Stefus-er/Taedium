 ###MISSIONS FOR SWEDEN###
 swe_engelbrekt_rebellion_title: "Engelbrekt Rebellion"
 swe_engelbrekt_rebellion_desc: "In 1434 and in 1436, brave Swedish miners and peasants, led by the nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson, raised their pickaxes and pitchforks in hope of freeing Sweden from the foul influence of the Danes. But of course, the rebellion broke apart when Engelbrekt was assassinated.\nWhile his rebellion might have failed, its spirit still lives on in our people. It is time to raise troops who are ready to fight for the independence of our country!"
 swe_military_advisor_title: "Military Advice"
 swe_military_advisor_desc: "The Engelbrekt Rebellion failed due to the assassination of Engelbrekt, as well as the support of Stockholm for the Danish crown. But even if Engelbrekt would have managed to gain the support of Stockholm, he had no military skills to lead the rebels to victory. We shall do better and ensure military advice when the moment of our independence war comes."
 swe_military_advisor_tt: "The event '§YThe End of the Kalmar Union§!' has fired and we decided for the option '§YFreedom!§!'."
 swe_conquest_of_novgorod_title: "Varangians' Legacy"
 swe_conquest_of_novgorod_desc: "The City of Novgorod was founded by the ancient Varangians of Scandinavia when they still followed the trade paths to the Byzantine Empire in the 8th century. Eventually, Novgorod became part of the East Slavic people and the old signs of Varangians vanished. But the city still is part of our ancient heritage and as such it is our right to reclaim it."
 swe_conquest_of_moscovy_title: "The City of the Rus"
 swe_conquest_of_moscovy_desc: "The city of Moscow is the home of the Muscovite people, who eventually adopted the Rus name. Like Novgord, so was Moscow founded by our ancestors, though they were mostly known as the Kievan Rus. Over the centuries, the connection between our people and Kievan Rus has become loose at best.\nHowever, the Russians of Muscovy have proven to be a formidable threat. It is in our interest to conquer their center of power to protect Sweden from their influence. The historical connection to the city is just a neat bonus."
 swe_high_income_title: "Increase our Income"
 swe_high_income_desc: "Scandinavia is not one of the richest regions of Europe. While our iron and especially our copper production keeps us above the deficit, it is still not enough revenue to secure a safe future for our [Root.GovernmentName]. We should increase our state income by any means necessary."
 swe_conquer_scania_title: "Swedish Skåneland"
 swe_conquer_scania_desc: "Skåneland is the Danish foothold in the mainland of Scandinavia. As long as Skåneland is in their hands we will always be vulnerable from the south. We should conquer this area as soon as possible in order to contain the threat of Denmark."
 swe_develop_dalaskogen_title: "Stora Kopparberget"
 swe_develop_dalaskogen_desc: "Stora Kopparberget is an old copper mine in [8.GetName], which quantity of pure copper ore has secured the economy of Sweden since as early as the 9th century. Under King Magnus IV the company which was responsible for the mining process received further privileges in 1347, which increased the production of copper even further.\nWhile Stora Kopparberget is already responsible for a sizable percentage of our income, their potential has not been fully reached yet."
 swe_industrialize_sweden_title: "Industrialize Sweden"
 swe_industrialize_sweden_desc: "Svealand is the heart of our economy. [8.GetAdjective] copper covers two thirds or Europe's demands while our iron and steel are highly sought after by the armies of this world. The demands of Europe for our metal seem to not end though. We should expand the industry of Svealand so we can cover the European markets.\nAlso, our own troops would be more than happy to fight with Swedish steel at the front too."
 swe_industrialize_sweden_tt: "from the provinces in §YSvealand§!, which produce §YCopper§! or §YIron§!."
 swe_swedish_allies_title: "Swedish Allies"
 swe_swedish_allies_desc: "While our people yearn for independence, our forces alone might not be enough to enforce our liberty from the Danes. We need to find allies outside Scandinavia who seek the destruction of the Kalmar Union."
 swe_swedish_allies_at: " rivals or enemies of §Y[DAN.GetName]§! have at least §Y100§! opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 swe_swedish_allies_bt: " rivals or enemies of our overlord have at least §Y100§! opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 swe_declare_independence_title: "Declare Independence!"
 swe_declare_independence_desc: "The time for our independence has finally come! Let us break this union of incompetence and establish a crown which is worthy to rule over Sweden!"
 swe_declare_independence_ct: "We will get an event, which grants us permanent claims on all provinces required for the missions '§YThe German Coastline§!', '§YWindow to the east§!' and '§YVarangians' Legacy§!' if we win the §YIndependence War§!."
 swe_claim_norwegian_crown_title: "The Crown of Norway"
 swe_claim_norwegian_crown_desc: "The Kalmar Union has been crippled by our independence, but it still remains due to the close ties between Denmark and Norway. Although the Danish king wants to deny it, Norway is mostly a province in the eyes of the Danish administration rather than a real kingdom of its own. It is our duty as good neighbor to free the Norwegians from Danish oppression and let them be ruled by a caring monarch for once."
 swe_fall_of_denmark_title: "Fall of Denmark"
 swe_fall_of_denmark_desc: "With Norway under our care, Denmark is all that is left of the once mighty Kalmar "Union". Still, our independence will always be threatened as long a Danish king exists. It is time to take Denmark for ourselves and do what the Kalmar Union never did: unite all of Scandinavia under one proper king."
 swe_colonial_ambitions_title: "Colonial Ambitions"
 swe_colonial_ambitions_desc: "The world is at the edge of a new era. Our neighbors are discovering landmasses beyond the Atlantic Ocean, or finding trade routes to India around Africa. They are gathering wealth and power while we are stuck in the North. We cannot allow us to slack behind all the other great powers. It is time that we set colonial ambitions of our own!"
 swe_colonial_ambitions_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on every §YCenter of Trade§! or province with an §YEstuary§! in §YColonial Eastern America§! and §YColonial Canada§!."
 swe_colonize_delaware_title: "New Sweden"
 swe_colonize_delaware_desc: "The New World is full of opportunities and wealth which our [Root.GovernmentName] can certainly use. It is of great priority that we establish settlements in the New World."
 swe_colonize_delaware_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on every §YCenter of Trade§! or province with an §YEstuary§! in §YColonial Caribbean§!."
 swe_colonize_caribbeans_title: "Colonize the Caribbean"
 swe_colonize_caribbeans_desc: "The Caribbean is the virtual center of trade of the New World. All paths eventually lead to the Caribbean and from there the trade flows into Europe. Whoever holds the Caribbean also holds the trade flow of two entire continents. Naturally, we must ensure that we are the ones who steer the New World's trade by colonizing these islands for ourselves."
 swe_colonialism_trade_desc: "Trade Control of the Caribbean"
 swe_colonize_random_new_world_title: "Colonize the New World"

Every tenth man between the age of 15 and 44 will be conscripted as permanent part of the national infantry while the Nobility, exempted from their taxes, have to provide with their cavalry. Due to this system, the usage of mercenaries has become less necessary as there is now a standing army for Sweden.\nEventually, the Allotment System received a new reformation, which makes the recruitment of potential soldiers province based instead of the villages. Every province of the Swedish empire has to contribute a regiment of 1200 Carolean units for the Swedish army."

In reality, however, it only served as an expanded source of wealth and manpower for the Danes, allowing the Danish kings the audacity to wage wars with the Hansa and cause troubles with the realms of Eastern Europe. The Danes made many enemies, and the majority of them would be more than happy to support us in our cause for independence.\nHowever, it would be more glorious if our kingdom manages to win the inevitable Independence War on its own, and that would bring us the respect of the other monarchies of Europe."

While it might be a strategical decision, it surely hampered the morale of our forces.\nDefinitely a disappointing start of the new [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Let us hope that future actions by the newly sovereign [Root.GetAdjective] government won't disappoint the [Root.GetAdjective] people any further."

After all, a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] can not survive in the wilderness just by [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself].\nAfter several weeks of travelling, searching and philosophizing, the curious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] company eventually found a forsaken temple with a small collection of idols of the several gods of the Norse faith. Upon touching them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] suffered a seizure and lost all of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses!\n\nTwo days later, after [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] servants established a small camp, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finally woke up from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] unwanted sleep."

Instead, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] studied every single script; every single documention about the old Norse religion. Although some worried about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sanity, the chats with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] revealed that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had not lost [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sharp mind in any way.\n\nOne day though, [Root.Monarch.GetName] vanished completely and messages from [new_norse_province.GetName] reached the court..."

His achievements set a signal for the Christian and Norse kingdoms alike and his legacy lived on to this very day.\n\nNow, the crowns of Scandinavia and the British Isles are once again united under one Norse banner. The jarls of the many territories bow before the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Undoubdetly, the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] is the true heir to the North Sea Empire.\nOnly one question is open: Should the [Root.GetAdjective] realm assume the name of "North Sea Empire"?"

 flavor_dan.107.d: "Our military needs proper bookkeeping."
 flavor_dan.108.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Merchants in [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_dan.108.desc: "Foreigners in strange cloths arrived in our country. At first we feared for the worst, but these strangers seem to be no conquerors but merchants.\nApparently, these traders are from [From.GetName] and seek out opportunities to invest in our economy in exchange for restricting our own trade within India."
 flavor_dan.108.a: "Accept the deal."
 flavor_dan.108.b: "Expel these foreigners from our land."
 flavor_dan.109.t: "The State of the Kalmar Union"
 flavor_dan.109.desc: "In the year of 1397, Queen Margaret I of Denmark incepted the Kalmar Union - a rather loose bound between the three Kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden with Denmark as the ruling power. However, the Act of the Union has never become a law in Sweden and Norway, and as such whenever the king of the Kalmar Union died, the two other Kingdoms had to elect the monarch of Denmark as their own ruler - a task which especially the Swedes have trouble to do.\n\nAdditionally to the struggle of keeping the Union together, the Nobility of Denmark itself is a threat to the stability of the Kalmar Union as the attention of the Danish King is split amongst the three Kingdoms. The nobles will regularly try to demand resources from the Crown to pursuit their own goals until their power has been greatly revoked."
 flavor_dan.109.a: "Difficult times are ahead..."
 flavor_dan.109.a.tt: "The Kalmar Union will cease to exist should §YSweden§! or §YNorway§! ever break free and win their independence war against us."
 flavor_dan.110.t: "Raise of the Sound Toll"
 flavor_dan.110.desc: "The greedy [From.GetAdjective] raised their already oppressing Sound Toll, and force half of our merchants into near bankruptcy just for travelling through Öresund. Complaints about it only reached the deaf ears of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle]. Every kind of diplomacy with [From.GetName] is futile, so we have only two options: submitting to the Sound Toll, or declare a Trade War on [From.GetName] like the Hanseatic League did years ago."
 flavor_dan.110.a: "That's it! [From.GetName] siphoned enough Ducats from us for far too long!"
 flavor_dan.110.a.tt: "Every member of our §YTrade League§!, which is not considering a war against [From.GetName] on their own, will join us in all Offensive Wars."

 flavor_dan.111.t: "[From.GetName] submits to [Root.GetAdjective] Trade Dominance"
 flavor_dan.111.desc: "Although the [From.GetAdjective] outcry was large when we increased the toll for members of the Haseatic League, the government of [From.GetName] had to submit to our dominance. The fear of complete annihiliation was larger than their worry of loss of profit."
 flavor_dan.111.a: "A wise decision from their [From.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 dan_submitted_to_danish_trade_dominance_tt: "§Y[From.GetName]§! sumits to our Trade Dominance."
 flavor_dan.112.t: "Norway in the Kalmar Union"
 flavor_dan.112.desc: "Prior to the Black Death, Norway was an equal amongst Sweden and Denmark and had its own strong nobility and royal court. However, the pestilence eventually reached Norway, and 60% of their population found a miserable death in 1348. Ever since this event, the Norwegian Crown degraded in importance and their nobility was replaced with Danes over time.\nNowadays, the Crown of Norway is the least important one of the three Kingdom titles. But voices within Norway wish to return their beloved country back to glory, and wish for more recognition within the Kalmar Union."
 flavor_dan.112.a: "Set the Crown of Norway equal to our own Crown."
 flavor_dan.112.b: "Keep the status quo."
 flavor_dan.112.c: "Degrade Norway into a [Root.GetAdjective] province instead."
 flavor_dan.113.t: "The Mercenaries of Germany"
 flavor_dan.113.desc: "Our people are well versed in the arts of war and our economy allows us to field a remarkable army to defend the homeland. However, our expectise is mostly on the sea.\nIn [GetYear], the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] gathered the leaders of the Germanic mercenary companies in [Root.Capital.GetName] to sign a royal contract between the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] and the mercenary companies. In exchange of the [Root.GetAdjective] wealth, the mercenaries promise their loyalty to the [Root.GetAdjective] crown."
 flavor_dan.113.a: "These mercenaries will surely prove their worth."
 flavor_dan.114.t: "Sweden in the Kalmar Union"
 flavor_dan.114.desc: "Unlike Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden is more difficult to keep within the Union. During the war between Denmark and the Hansa in 1435, Sweden experienced economical issues caused by the Hansa. As a result of it, the miner and nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson raised a small army of revolters and rebels. The Kalmar Union as we know it today might have ceased to exist already if it was not for his premature death.\nIt is clear that the Swedish nobility is no longer happy with [Root.GetAdjective] involvement in their affairs. Fortunately for us, some of the Swedish ruling class are pro-unionist. We could use our resources to persuade the remaining nobility and convert them into pro-unionists too."
 flavor_dan.114.a: "Try to persuade the rest of the nobility to our cause."
 flavor_dan.114.b: "They will eventually become pro-unionist on their own."
 flavor_dan.114.c: "To deal with the Swedish Nobility is pointless. Exploit Sweden's resources instead."
 flavor_dan.115.t: "The Dream of Freedom"
 flavor_dan.115.desc: "Although the [Root.GetAdjective] nobles meant the best for [Root.GetName] when they signed the Kalmar Union treaty, none of our people has the wish to be underneath the Danish Crown. The dream of an independent Sweden is starting to get more and more attractive..."
 flavor_dan.115.a: "One day this dream will become reality!"
 flavor_dan.117.t: "Discontent of the [Root.GetAdjective] Nobility"
 flavor_dan.117.desc: "With the draft of a Scnadinavian Constitution, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] is preparing the ratification of the Kalmar Union - and our eventual integration into the [From.GetAdjective] Crown. As this constitution is removing power from the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName], the discontent within our [Root.GovernmentName] is rising. While pro-unionists try to defend the [From.GetAdjective] decisions, the anti-unionists are preparing their forces for another revolt against the Kalmar Union..."
 flavor_dan.117.a: "[From.GetName] cannot control us forever."
 flavor_dan.118.t: "The brewing Revolution of [From.GetName]"
 flavor_dan.118.desc: "The tensions between [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetAdjective] nobility is reaching a new height. The establishment of the Scandinavian Constitution rubbed many of the [From.GetAdjective] ruling class the wrong way, and even some anti-unionists within [Root.GetName] are preparing to raise arms against the Kalmar Union.\nA large revolution is on the horizon. We must act unless we want to face the wrath of several [From.GetAdjective] pretender rebels."
 flavor_dan.118.a: "We can handle the revolts."
 flavor_dan.118.b: "We should gather the [From.GetAdjective] anti-unionists and... deal with them."
 flavor_dan.119.t: "A new Capital for the North Sea Empire?"
 flavor_dan.119.desc: "When Cnut the Great conquered England, he ensured his reign by ruling over England from the city of London while the already secured that the lands of Denmark and Norway were handled by his Norse wife.\nAfter so many centuries, the North Sea Empire is now restored once again, though this time England was not conquered by [Root.GetAdjective] Vikings but by our advanced society. Still, ruling over England will pose a problem due to the distance between [Root.Capital.GetName] and the English lands. It might be worth relocating our capital to London once again."
 flavor_dan.119.a: "[236.GetName] shall be our new capital!"
 flavor_dan.119.b: "Expand [Root.Capital.GetName] instead."
 flavor_dan.120.t: "Regression in the English Channel"
 flavor_dan.120.desc: "Our loss of the trade influence in the English Channel is causing a massive hit to our trade revenues and our access to the many wonderful goods from the New World."
 flavor_dan.120.a: "Darn..."
 flavor_dan.122.t: "The Consequences of the Bloodbath"
 flavor_dan.122.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] travelled to the capital of Sweden and invited all Swedish nobles to a great festival to celebrate his coronation. Although hesitantly, the Swedish nobility accepted the invitation and travelled to the center of the capital.\nShortly after the arrival of all the nobles, however, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ordered a trial against the Swedish nobility, and exectued the majority of the nobles for heresy.\n\nWhile this act was a gruesome one, it was one of necessity for our [Root.GovernmentName]. The Kalmar Union would fall apart if anti-unionist thoughts were to spread further in Sweden. The population of Sweden sees this event as a proof of Danish tyranny though..."
 flavor_dan.122.a: "It had to be done. The Swedish people will have to accept it."
 flavor_dan.123.t: "The Pretender War of Sweden"
 flavor_dan.123.desc: "Our inactions motivated more and more Swedish nobility to gather their allies and to start open revolts against our rule. However, not all of Sweden see their actions as justified and the atrocities done by the rebels in the name of "freedom and liberty" are causing heavy devastation to the Swedish lands. The nobles are making themselves highly unpopular with the Swedish commoners.\nWhile this Pretender War will be highly costly to our treasury and our manpower, it will at least show the Swedes that the [Root.GetAdjective] rule is not one of tyranny but of justice - unlike the one their nobilites try to enforce."
 flavor_dan.123.a: "Finally the Swedes accept our rule."
 flavor_dan.124.t: "The Changing Role of the Mercenaries"
 flavor_dan.124.desc: "Ever since the days of the Roman Empire, kings and generals relied on mercenaries for their wars, and [Root.GetName] is no exception to this. But as time went on, the governments of Europe established the concept of standing armies; military forces which are recruited from their own people who can be called to arms in times of need. Our advisors are divided. On the one hand the usage of a standing army guarentees that we are using professional and loyal soldiers for the defense of our ambitions. On the other hand, we would have to be ready to sacrifice good [Root.GetAdjective] lives for our goals.\nIn the end it is up to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to make the final decision."
 flavor_dan.124.a: "We should stick with the mercenary armies."

Following this, our order established a state in West and East Prussia and we continued our crusade against the Romuva Lithuanians.\nHowever, our presence in Prussia has always been a thorn in the side for the Kingdom of Poland. And even the Lithuanians, which we spent so many decades converting, seek our destruction!\n\nAlthough the Holy Roman Empire is not particularly benevolent to our order, they are the only power which would be ready to defend us from the Polish threat."

Although we have attracted occasional sympathy and aid from the German lands, most of the Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire have not paid us much attention, nor have we bothered with them - focused as we are on our war against the pagans of the Baltics, after all.\n\nOccasionally, our battles have attracted mercenaries from the Empire - although not always favouring our side, as at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. But for the most part though our realms coexisted without much interaction. However, with the looming threat of the Polish Kingdom it is time to reach out to the Emperor and seek Imperial protection. The question is what demands might they make in agreeing to protect us..."

The council of knights and advisors gathered together in [Root.Capital.GetName] to discuss our further approach. Half of the council suggests to put our efforts into the conquest of Germany so it can be unified under one single banner. The other half stresses out that the threat from Poland and Ruthenia is not gone yet, and that we should instead concentrate our efforts in conquering these regions.\n\nIn the end, it is up to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide what path we shall follow."

In return, we promised him to protect the southeastern border of the Hungarian Kingdom from the threat of the Cumans.\nFor fourteen years, the Order enjoyed special privileges such as the exemption from taxes and the right to establish markets and to administer justice. These were all lost when Andrew's heir, Béla, and the Hungarian nobility expelled us from our rightful lands.\n\nAfter over 200 years, the Burzenland is once again under Teutonic control. During our absence, the once wooden fortification of Dietrichstein has been torn down. In its place is now the Bran Castle instead, which architecture caught the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors. The question has risen of if we should use the resources of Carpathia to expand the Bran Castle and make it into our new capital, or if we should remain in [1841.GetName] and use them for the Marienburg."

Ever since, our Order has grown in numbers while living by the virtues and values of poverty, chastity and obedience. Due to the nature of our core values, the Teutonic Order ran short on available Ducats.\nFortunately for us, the Hansa still remembers our origins and has provided us in the past with ships and monetary support for our conquest of Prussia. In return, we had to provide protection for the merchants of the Hansa, though this eventually turned into an error for our state as said merchants formed later the threatening Prussian Confederation.\n\nStill, the Hansa is a valuable asset to our treasury.

However, their recent history of wars against Poland and an already Christianized Lithuania gave these knights a rather bad reputation. No longer are they fighting for the Holy See but for personal gains, and the counties bordering the Order fear aggression from the Order's side.\nWhile more members in the Empire is always a welcome sight, accepting the Order into the Empire - even if it is only temporarily - might make [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] of [Emperor.GetName] rather unpopular with the duchies which border this order."

 ###LIVONIAN EVENTS###
 flavor_liv.0.t: "The Situation of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.0.desc: "The Livonian Order is the successor of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, an order of knights which was annihilated by the Samogitians in 1236. While technically a vassal of the Teutonic Order, the Livonian Order has remained mostly autonomous.\nHowever, our order has its fair share of challenges. The Kalmar Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\nBut that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain.\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny. If we manage to end this confederacy, and manage to push our enemies back then our state can make a choice of which path we shall follow."
 flavor_liv.0.a.tt: "The §YLivonian Order§! has a unique mission tree, which is more flexible than other mission trees. After finishing the mission '§YStrengthen Our Authority§!' we will receive an event, which allows us to replace the Branching Missions with missions from one of the two following paths:\n\n§YLivonian Path§!\nThe Livonian Path is one about secularizing and dissolving the Livonian Order, and reforming into the nation of §YLivonia§!. It will revolve around the development of the §YBaltic§! region and the colonization of the §YNew World§!. It will also allow us to form our own §YGovernment§!, which is forged by our needs and actions.\n\n§YCrusader Path§!\nThe Crusader Path is one about sticking to the purpose of the Order, which is the Christianizing of Heathens and Heretics. Your mission tree will lead you on a campaign of conquest and coversion of §YRussia§! and establishing a Catholic Empire in §YEastern Europe§!."
 flavor_liv.1.t: "The Future of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.1.desc: "Our Order managed to get the Livonian Confederacy at bay, and secured a future. However, it is apparent that our Order is lacking a proper direction. The dawn of a new era is approaching, and it is now more than ever time to choose how the direction of our state shall look like."
 flavor_liv.1.a: "The time of the crusades is over. We shall become a secularized realm!"
 flavor_liv.1.a.tt: "Unlock the §YLivonian§! mission path."
 flavor_liv.1.b: "Our crusade is not concluded as long the Schism persists!"
 flavor_liv.1.b.tt: "Unlock the §YCrusader§! mission path. All missions require us to stay §YCatholic§!."

 flavor_liv.2.t: "Dissolution of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.2.desc: "Our army is ready to enforce the dissolution of one of the members of the Livonian Confederacy. The question is: which Bishopric should be our target?"
 flavor_liv.2.a: "The Bishopric of Dorpat has been a thorn in our side for far too long."
 flavor_liv.2.b: "We must crush the Bishopric of Ösel."
 flavor_liv.2.c: "It is time to end the Bishopric of Courland."
 flavor_liv.2.d: "The Bishop of Reval shall submit."
 flavor_liv.2.e: "We cannot dissolve any of these Bishoprics..."
 flavor_liv.2.f: "What Bishoprics?"
 flavor_liv.3.t: "Purchase of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.3.desc: "The Livonian Confederacy is making it difficult to maintain our rule over the lands of Curonia, Livonia and Estonia. Fortunately, these bishops are not the saints they claim to be, and are willing to sell their land to us."
 flavor_liv.3.a: "The Bishopric of Dorpat has been a thorn in our side for far too long."
 flavor_liv.3.b: "We must buy the Bishopric of Ösel."
 flavor_liv.3.c: "It is time to end the Bishopric of Courland."
 flavor_liv.3.d: "The Bishop of Reval shall enjoy his money."
 flavor_liv.4.t: "Secularization of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.4.desc: "We are an Order of knights, which had only one goal: the Christianization of the Baltic lands - and we achieved this goal. However, with the Reformation spreading it has become more and more apparent to us that our order has lost its point, and a crusade against fellow Christians is more than absurd according to our advisors.\nMaybe it is finally time to dissolve the Livonian Order as we know it, and form a proper kingdom - the Kingdom of Livonia."
 flavor_liv.4.a: "From this day forth the world shall know us as Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.4.b: "We cannot dissolve our Order just yet."
 flavor_liv.5.t: "Prussian-Livonian Alliance"
 flavor_liv.5.desc: "Prussia is the successor of the Teutonic Order, our old ally and former overlord.

 flavor_liv.5.a: "Our both countries shall stand united against any threat!"
 flavor_liv.6.t: "The Creation of a new Government"
 flavor_liv.6.desc: "Our secularization made our country into a monarchy like many others around us. However, as our state is relatively young in comparison, we lack the experiences and traditions our neighbors have made during their lifetime. Even our allies in the Prussian lands have started to introduce systems of efficient administration to their monarchy.\nIt is time that we learn from the experiences of our neighbors, and shape a monarchy which suits our needs."
 flavor_liv.6.a: "Les us found a Monarchy worthy to be part of Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.7.t: "Livonia declares the end of the Schism"
 flavor_liv.7.desc: "Having the Russian lands fallen into Catholic hands, the knights of Livonia have declared that the Great Schism has ended and that all the Christendom shall follow the leadership of the Papacy. This is however not something that the Pope himself has endorsed, so the validity of the declaration is still under doubt, but these conquests may be an indication that God himself favors Catholicism."
 flavor_liv.7.a: "God's intention is clear, the Pope shall lead."
 flavor_liv.7.b: "Some mere knights cannot dismiss the Patriarchs."
 flavor_liv.8.t: "Decline of the Lübeck Trade Dominance"
 flavor_liv.8.desc: "We gained access to the Lübeck trade through various means and ways, which allowed us to grow in wealth and power. So much so that we finally managed to expand westwards, and acquired a center of trade near Lübeck itself.\nDue to our progress, the Hansa felt threatened and started limiting our access to their market now."
 flavor_liv.8.a: "Quite unfortunate."
 flavor_liv.13.t: "Question of Teutonic-Livonian Relations"
 flavor_liv.13.desc: "The Teutonic Order have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders. Working together with them we were able to christianize these regions, but our cooperation could be increased even further. If we tighten our mutual bonds, the benefits for the Faith could be unmeasurable."

 flavor_liv.13.b: "Our alliance with the Teutonic Order is just a means for the end."
 flavor_liv.14.t: "Bound between Livonia and the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_liv.14.desc: "The knights of Livonia have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders. Working together with them we were able to christianize these regions, but our cooperation could be increased even further. The Livonian knights have come to us to that effect and established a headquarter in our capital. We should return the favor."

 ###RIGAN EVENTS###
 flavor_rig.1.t: "Subjugation of the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_rig.1.desc.a: "The Teutonic Order has long since guarded the Prussian lands to our South. Originally sent there by the Pope with the express purpose of converting the heathens that inhabited the provinces, they've long since outlived their usefulness, debasing themselves by conducting raids and harassing even those with whom they share a common faith.\n\nAs the Holy Father wills it, these unruly lost souls  have been brought back to virtue and the true Catholic way. Their service will be useful to our seat of power as well as Rome herself."
 flavor_rig.1.desc.b: "The Teutonic Order has long since guarded the Prussian lands to our South. Originally sent there by the Pope with the express purpose of converting the heathens that inhabited the provinces, they've long since outlived their usefulness, debasing themselves by conducting raids and harassing even those with whom they share a common faith.\n\nDespite our religious difference and disagreements in matters of divinity and faith, we must nevertheless recognize their experience and expertise as capable warriors. Perhaps it would be wise and prudent to keep them on a short leash... "
 flavor_rig.1.a: "They will prove themselves on the battlefield."
 flavor_rig.2.t: "The Decaying Influence of Riga"
 flavor_rig.2.desc: "For long, our country has been chained by the court in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Recent events in the western baltic shores have led to our former overlord losing his grip on our local affairs. Utilizing our newfound independence, God willed it that we may be victorious against the once-great [Root.Overlord.GetName]."
 flavor_rig.2.a: "May we never fall pray to another ambitious conqueror again!"
 flavor_rig.3.t: "A Power Once Beholden"
 flavor_rig.3.desc: "Recent defeats across our domain, combined with the waning power of our authority over Prussia, have led to the famed Teutonic Order sliping through our grasp. This development has led many to believe that the end times are nigh, as our enemies encroach our borders on all sides..."
 flavor_rig.3.a: "Can we recover from this?"
 flavor_rig.4.t: "To Lose One's Domain"
 flavor_rig.4.desc: "Recent defeats across our domain, combined with the waning power of our authority over our Livonian territory, have led to the famed Livonian Order sliping through our grasp.

 flavor_rig.4.a: "The future is clouded with uncertainty..."
 flavor_rig.9.t: "A Place within the Holy Roman Empire?"
 flavor_rig.9.desc: "The situation in the Baltic is dire. The neighboring Orders of Livonia and Prussia have been embroiled in a decades-long struggle with their southern neighbors of Poland and Lithuania. This uncertainty cannot be allowed to continue as the need to secure our future arises. To that end, we may send royal messengers to the halls of the Holy Roman Emperor, petitioning to join the defensive confederation that they are spearheading. Many voices in our court are deliberating in regards to this matter, given that joining the Empire would imply giving up some of our autonomy as we will be subject to Imperial law and jurisdiction."
 flavor_rig.9.a: "We must join the Empire!"
 flavor_rig.9.b: "Let them talk. We stay outside the Empire."
 flavor_rig.10.t: "Religion as a Business"
 flavor_rig.10.desc: "Although faith is and will always be the driving force of our government, it is clear that our society has a very plutocratic nature. Merchants of all classes sell crucifixs, items which are claimed to be blessed by the Lord himself and, of course, indulgences for their sins to sell such items in the first place.\nReligion is a business - a business we could benefit from if we embrace the commerce revolving around it."
 flavor_rig.10.a: "Certainly, the Lord would allow us to embrace these practices."
 flavor_rig.10.b: "Blasphemy! The mercy of the Lord must not be treated as merchant's wares!"
 flavor_rig.11.desc: "The Reformation hit our country and we have decided to turn our back on the vile corruption and greed of the Catholic church. However, even a state of zeal as ours must admit the monetary gain from these heretic Indulgences. The advisors of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] suggest that we maintain a focus on trade and commerce - but not in the name of personal gain but for the sake of the Reformation."
 flavor_rig.11.a: "The advisors are making a good point."
 flavor_rig.11.b: "And what makes us better than the Catholics? No, we remain true to the Reformation."
 flavor_rig.12.t: "The Dissolution of the Hanseatic League?"
 flavor_rig.12.desc: "Times of trouble are ahead of us! The members of our League have lost their faith in our leadership as their individual strength and influence soar. They have become so brazen that a delegation from Riga, arriving this morning, demanded we dissolve the mercantile pact or face dire consequences!"
 flavor_rig.12.a: "We must accept..."
 flavor_rig.12.a.tt: "Set [This.GetName]'s Prestige to §R-75§!."
 flavor_rig.12.b: "Over my cold dead mercantile coprse!"
 flavor_rig.13.t: "Merchant Crossroads?"
 flavor_rig.13.desc: "The decaying influence of the merchants of Lübeck has given rise to the city of Riga. Wielding its growing influence, the merchant men of Riga managed to force the dissolutiion of the Hanseatic League, demanding all former members to join the mercantile pact that they will now lead. Whether we decide to join or go our own way, a feeling of uncertainty lingers in the air..."
 flavor_rig.13.a: "Riga or Lübeck makes no difference, coin is coin!"
 flavor_rig.13.b: "Is this an out-of-season April Fool's joke?"

However, the recent attempts to consolidate power by our monarch have seemingly caused an open rebellion, spearheaded by the most powerful families within our domain."
 flavor_pol.23.a: "There can only be one!"
 
 flavor_pol.24.t: "The Constitution of [GetYear]"
 flavor_pol.24.d: "The administration of the Polish crown has been in dire straits for as long as anyone can remember. With the landed nobles' power at peak, passing jurisprudence and signing reforms has been a nightmarish endeavor. With what can be described as unique diplomatic and administrative prowess, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to accumulate enough political capital, as well as favors, to rid our court of these pesky feudal leeches."
 flavor_pol.24.a: "The nation is in dire need of reforms!"
 flavor_pol.24.b: "Some reforms are in order."
 flavor_pol.24.c: "All shall be equal under the Polish banner!"
 
 flavor_pol.25.t: "The Polish-Bohemian Pact of Cooperation"
 flavor_pol.25.d: "It is said that close cooperation and diplomacy can make or break the fate of nations. Recent attempts to reconcile our differences with our Polish brethren in the East have led to the culmination of the Polish-Bohemian pact of Cooperation of the year [GetYear]. It is up to us how and in which manner to proceed and react to such a profound extension of friendship and cohabitation."
 flavor_pol.25.a: "The crown of Poland will lead the way for a union of our states."

 flavor_pol.26.c: "I wouldn't wipe my boots with the Polish banner!"
 
 flavor_pol.27.t: "Expanding the Quarter Army"
 flavor_pol.27.d: "The foundations of a regular army were established in Poland in the transition from the 15th to the 16th centuries, to protect its south-eastern borderlands from the Tatar raids. This system was expanded in 1563, when Sigismund II Augustus broke a deal with the Sejm to fund it with a quarter of all the revenues collected at the royal lands, from where it took its name, the Quarter Army. Now, to safeguard our people, protect our interests, and maintain our growth and prosperity, we must move along with the times and embrace any and all useful technological advancements, especially in the military field and the conduct of warfare. Our choice in this matter will surely echo in the chambers of history."
 flavor_pol.27.a: "A general reform would fit our army nicely!"
 flavor_pol.27.b: "Reform the Hussar cavalry!"
 flavor_pol.27.c: "Improve our firing techniques."
 flavor_pol.27.dee: "Focus entirely on expanding the cavalry!"
 
 flavor_pol.28.t: "Collegium Maius & the Growth of Thought"
 flavor_pol.28.d: "Wealth and inheritance are powerful tools when employed for the benefit of the public. Such is the story of the first Academy in Krakow, Collegium Maius. The essence of a thinking nation, captivated within the beautiful walls of a Renaissance-styled building shall pave the way for our glorious minds and their path to the stars, offering knowledge and growth to great men such as Nikolaus Copernicus."
 flavor_pol.28.a: "A glorious establishment to cultivate the future generations!"
 
 flavor_pol.29.t: "Securing the Moldavian Domain"
 flavor_pol.29.d: "The situation in Moldavia has turned quite dire. Our ducal neighbor to the South has fallen from the public's grace as of late. Indeed, the country was recently embroiled in a vicious and bloody civil war. But, out of chaos comes order and we must be better than our Moldavian predecessors when it comes to ruiling the land. Thus, preparations and decisions are in order to safeguard our interests and grip on the region."
 flavor_pol.29.a: "Let Stefan have the throne, he will serve us well!"
 flavor_pol.29.b: "We can't risk meddling in local feuds..."
 flavor_pol.29.c: "They answer to ME!"
 
 flavor_pol.30.t: "The Crown of Rome"
 flavor_pol.30.d: "The glorious city of [151.GetName] is in our hands! Once the great capital of Byzantium, the Turkish armies of the Ottoman Sultanate conquered the city and removed the Byzantine Empire from the face of the Earth.\nBut today, the city is free from the clutches of the Ottomans! While the majority of [Root.GetName] is celebrating our conquest of the city, the [Root.GetAdjective] court is concerned about the government of [151.GetName]. While it would be prestigeous to keep the city for ourselves, the advisors of [Root.Monarch.GetName] suggest to re-establish the state of Byzantium or the great Latin Empire."
 flavor_pol.30.a: "Restore the §YPhoenix§! to its former glory."
 flavor_pol.30.b: "The §YLatin Empire§! shall live once more!"
 flavor_pol.30.c: "[151.GetName] belongs to us!"
 
 flavor_pol.31.t: "Baltic Gold & the Gates of Kings"
 flavor_pol.31.d: "Vanquishing our enemies and rummaging through their domain, taking what is rightfully ours is only half the joy. What good is wealth without a home to return to? A home adorned with golden arches, the architecture conceptualized by scores of Renaissance men, eager to leave their mark on one of the world's most influential and important cities. [43.GetName] bears all the marks necessary to be the home of our ever-growing nation."
 flavor_pol.31.a: "A city befitting royalty!"
 
 flavor_pol.32.t: "Negotiations of Lublin"
 flavor_pol.32.d: "It is no secret that power and influence have an adverse effect on people. However, power wielded carefully and guided by a steady hand can yield tremendously positive results for our foreign and domestic affairs. The infantile nobles of Lithuania have been pestering us with their refusal to participate in the Sejm Diets and congregations, grinding the entire process to a halt. If they do not comprehend the diplomatic tongue, perhaps they would be more atuned to a show of strength at the expense of their own lands?"
 flavor_pol.32.a: "Force the Lithuanians to sign the agreement."
 flavor_pol.32.b: "We cannot risk our delicate relations..."
 
 flavor_pol.33.t: "The Sejm Diet of [GetYear]"
 flavor_pol.33.d: "One quiet morning in [GetYear], the messenger bursts through the doors of the Imperial palace, red and flustered, eager to deliver a valuable correspondence from the seat of power in Poland. Apparently, the local noble of Poland who was recently crowned a King decided, against the calls of his own advisors, to steer his nation away from its ties to Lithuania, turning its gaze upon the West. As a result, the monarch of Poland has officially petitioned for the entry of his country in the Holy Roman Empire."
 flavor_pol.33.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!"
 flavor_pol.33.b: "As long as we are the heads of the Empire, they shall never join it!"

Now, Polish messengers bring word, asking for our very own Kazimierz to relocate to the Polish capital in order to govern both our nations from his newfound seat of power.

However, other voices in our council support the idea of a direct governorship or even the inclusion of the nomadic horselords into our administration until their eventual and total assimilation."

 #Events 
 flavor_hsa.5.t: "Novgorodian Kontor"
 flavor_hsa.5.d: "Novgorod had been once an important country for the Hanseatic League, though not a member of the League itself, due to its access to great quantities of quality fur. Our kontor (entrepôt) in their country was thus a key source of wealth for the League. Recent developments in the diplomatic and geographical front have resulted in our merchants regaining their long-lost offices in Veliky Novgorod!"
 flavor_hsa.5.a: "A historic day for the people of Lübeck!"
 
 flavor_hsa.6.t: "The Lübeck Herring Market"
 flavor_hsa.6.d: "The presence of large schools of herring fish around the Falsterbo peninsula is legendary. For ages our people spoke of tales about the overabundance of them, as our fishermen provided our folk with valuable and fresh merchandise. Such abundance of easily obtainable fish has been providing the markets in and around Skane, being the source of great wealth for all merchants involved in the herring trade.\n\nEmbarking on the market as a competitor to Skane would probably prove to be very profitable. However, despite the abundance of marine life in the pass, many advisors in our court suggest we best stay loyal to our main export, Lubeckian naval supplies."
 flavor_hsa.6.a: "Let us compete against our neighbors!"
 flavor_hsa.6.b: "We could never abandon our traditions..."
 flavor_hsa.6.c: "Let us pioneer preservation methods to outproduce our competitors!"
 
 flavor_hsa.7.t: "Docks & Wharfs of Bryggen"
 flavor_hsa.7.d: "The Hanseatic League has been present in Norway for centuries, since they started their activites in the kontor of Bryggen. It quickly became a very important trading center, dominating the trade along the Norwegian coast. However, since then the League's influence in the city had dwindled, its offices and storehouses being taken by local merhants.\n\nAround [GetYear], an office of the Hanseatic League was re-established in the city. As the area once again regained its importance as a trading centre for the League, the facilities around the port, including the warfs and storage buildings, flourished and were greatly expanded in an attempt to provide mercantile capacity to the new influx of traders."
 flavor_hsa.7.a: "Entrepreneurship and cooperation at their finest!"
 
 flavor_hsa.8.t: "The Hanseatic Town of Visby"
 flavor_hsa.8.d: "The natural harbor of Visby has for long been an important trade center of the Baltic. Local merchants collaborated effortlessly with their foreign counterparts and the city became the linking port between the cold Russian wastelands and merchants from the European west. Simultaneously, the city hosts an impressive set of fortifications, further improving the image of a sturdy and dependable mercantile destination."
 flavor_hsa.8.a: "This is the fruit of the League's labors!"
 
 flavor_hsa.9.t: "The Danzig Confederation"
 flavor_hsa.9.d: "Originally formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of nobles and clergy of several cities in Prussia as opposition to the mercantile regulations imposed by the Teutonic Knights, the Danzig Confederation quickly became a powerful player in the internal politics of the region. Eventually, they would go on to seek the protection of the Polish King as the latter took up arms against the Teutons.\n\nDespite the conflicts between the aforementioned parties, Danzig now lies within our sphere of influence. As a result, the merchants of the City and members of the Confederation have come to our court in Lübeck to barter and ask for access to our prosperous markets."
 flavor_hsa.9.a: "We can allow their influence in our cities."
 flavor_hsa.9.b: "No foreign meddling!"
 
 flavor_hsa.10.t: "Town Hall of Lübeck"
 flavor_hsa.10.d: "Due to the geographically favorable position of Lübeck, the great majority of the annual meetings of the merchant members of the Hanseatic League take place in the city. As such, we are the president of the League, with the capacity of leading and deciding the course the whole League should take. The new Town Hall erected in [GetYear] will serve as the central assembly and deliberation chamber for matters of the League. Its impressive architecture and magnificence will be a testament to both the importance of our city and the affluence of wealth of the Hanseatic League as a whole."
 flavor_hsa.10.a: "Beide part schal ein richter horen und den ordel"
 
 flavor_hsa.11.t: "The City Gates of Lübeck"
 flavor_hsa.11.d: "A city as important in the trade flow as Lübeck is sure to accumulate great quantities of wealth, and as such, attract the attention of all greedy nations around it. This makes the presence of city walls not just a necessity, but a vital part of the existence of the city itself. Fortunately enough, we haven't been slackening in our duty to ensure the safety of our city and wealth, and the impressive fortifications surrounding it are a testament to that. The multiple walls and gates surrounding our city will make sure that nobody dares try to attack us to steal our wealth."
 flavor_hsa.11.a: "May they stagger our enemies!"
 
 flavor_hsa.12.t: "Theory of Mercantilism"
 flavor_hsa.12.d: "Mercantilism was an economic theory and practice prevalent in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It emphasized the accumulation of wealth through a favorable balance of trade, primarily through exports. Governments actively promoted exports and discouraged imports through various measures like tariffs and subsidies. The goal was to increase a nation's wealth and power by accumulating gold and silver and building a strong domestic industry while eliminating foreign competition."
 flavor_hsa.12.a: "Money makes the world go round!"
 
 flavor_hsa.13.t: "The Hanseatic Cog"
 flavor_hsa.13.d: "To facilitate our efforts in our mercantile adventures, we will need the proper infrastructure and vehicles to move our merchandise. Thus, for the purpose of trading, we shall adopt the Hanseatic Cog, a bulky freighter with one mast and a square sail. The ship will become the symbol of financial prowess and affluence, traversing the sealanes and connecting our many ports!"
 flavor_hsa.13.a: "A marvellous vessel to ferry our goods and merchants!"
 
 flavor_hsa.14.t: "Adler von Lübeck"
 flavor_hsa.14.d: "The Adler von Lübeck, the largest ship our fleet has ever seen, shall be the pride of our navy. Even our most powerful and navally capable foes will tremble at her size and firepower as she gracefully takes to the seas!\n\nSuch naval prowess displayed by Adler will certainly be the object of envy in the eyes of our rivals. To safeguard its legitimacy and aura of invincibility would mean that our nation will continue to benefit from its glorious name."
 flavor_hsa.14.a: "Let the sound of our artillery silence the screams of our enemies!"
 
 flavor_hsa.16.t: "Trade Privileges of the Hansa"
 flavor_hsa.16.d: "The city of Danzig, now lying firmly in our grasp, used to be a hub of trade under the once-mighty Hanseatic League, situated in Lübeck. Since then, the League has fallen from grace due to a plethora of factors and has had its power in the Baltic and beyond challenged. Despite these shortcomings, recent developments around the banks of Germany and the Baltic have led to the League regaining its standing. Once again, the powerful merchants of the Hansa come to Danzig, with a lucrative offer..."
 flavor_hsa.16.a: "Offer them a lucrative deal!"
 flavor_hsa.16.b: "Forget about it!"
 
 flavor_hsa.17.t: "A Royal Offer for Danzig"
 flavor_hsa.17.d: "The Polish court has approached our merchants with a lucrative offer. Given the expansive nature of our trade and the recent developments of the Hanseatic League regaining its old glory, they wish to parlay in regards to granting the city of Danzig back to the League. Such a diplomatic move will certainly come at a cost, but it might be wise to consider it and attempt to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed towards or against the Polish crown and its mighty army, lest we risk the destruction of what we struggled to build thus far."
 flavor_hsa.17.a: "An agreeable proposal"
 flavor_hsa.17.b: "This is madness!"
 flavor_hsa.17.c: "Let the head of the Hansa negotiate a better deal."
 
 flavor_hsa.18.t: "The Stalhof Kontor"
 flavor_hsa.18.d: "For centuries the merchants of Lübeck have traded valuables all across the Northern seas. Recent developments on the diplomatic fronts have resulted in the [236.Owner.GetAdjective] monarchy granting certain Lubeckian individuals the ability to not only freely travel to and from London but also the green light to establish offices around the most crowded areas of the city's port. That historically culminated in the creation of the Steelyard, a series of offices dedicated to the merchants of the Hansa that had a positive effect for both nations."
 flavor_hsa.18.a: "Our merchants are renowned from London to Novgorod!"
 
 flavor_hsa.19.t: "Coin and Diplomacy from the Hansa"
 flavor_hsa.19.d: "For centuries the merchants of Lübeck have traded valuables all across the Northern seas. Recent developments on the diplomatic fronts have resulted in the [Root.GetAdjective] monarchy granting certain Lubeckian individuals the ability to not only freely travel to and from London but also the green light to establish offices around the most crowded areas of the city's port. That historically culminated in the creation of the Steelyard, a series of offices dedicated to the merchants of the Hansa that had a positive effect for both nations."
 flavor_hsa.19.a: "Their wealth will be safe in London!"
 
 flavor_hsa.20.t: "The Lifeblood of Lübeck"
 flavor_hsa.20.d: "The regulation of timber and workforce in the maritime sector was once the lifeblood of our great republic. During the early 15th century however, we lost the monopoly on shipbuilding and the goods associated to it and thus lost the firm grasp on the seas themselves. Despite numerous setbacks the Hansa has recently rediscovered its long-lost power in the trade of naval supplies by re-establishing control over the markets of our home city and abroad. What this means for our future not many can clearly say, but the positive development of our city returning to its roots is certainly a sign of prosperous times to come!"
 flavor_hsa.20.a: "We are the masters of timber once more!"
 
 flavor_hsa.21.t: "Georg Giese - A Famous Merchant"
 flavor_hsa.21.d: "Being a nation that funnels such an abundance of trade, we see great movement of goods and people of great value. One such prominent individual is Georg Giese, a talented merchant from Danzig who has been managing his family office in our London kontor for years. His operations there have been a great success and, our profits and influence in the London market have been greatly increased thanks to him. Now that he has come back from London it seems that we can use his great potential in a more direct way."
 flavor_hsa.21.a: "He shall lead our people to greatness."
 flavor_hsa.21.b: "Despite his skill, we must follow republican procedures..."
 flavor_hsa.21.c: "His abilities are invaluable!"
 
 flavor_hsa.22.t: "Albrecht Moldenhauer"
 flavor_hsa.22.d: "The Hanseatic League is a congregation, or rather a loose alliance, between many merchants from all across the territories of the mighty Holy Roman Empire and beyond. Many merchants have come and gone, some more gifted at making legendary fortunes and securing themselves a spot at the pages of history and others less so. \n\nFew however, have left such a dent in history as Albrecht Moldenhauer, a genius merchant from our city of Lübeck. He has been crucial in the development of trade with Sweden and Norway, and thanks to him goods flowing through both countries have been greatly increased. We can no doubt use talented individuals like him."
 flavor_hsa.22.a: "His mercantile expertise is astonishing."
 
 flavor_hsa.23.t: "Grevens Fejde"
 flavor_hsa.23.d: "The situation in Denmark, given the recent disastrous developments, is dire. The court of their feeble monarch is torn asunder as petty nobles fight over the royal authority, as well as the right to exercise it. Recently, we have been approached by foreign agents purporting to be messengers of the rebelling factions in the court of Denmark. They suggest that a monetary donation of a certain magnitude would assist them in their endeavours against their tyrannical overlord. Whatever the case may be, this could be our chance to mingle in Danish politics and weaken their crown authority!"
 flavor_hsa.23.a: "This is our chance!"
 flavor_hsa.23.b: "We will stand firmly with the royal family of Denmark."
 
 flavor_hsa.24.t: "The New Staple Port in Amsterdam"
 flavor_hsa.24.d: "Many factors certainly have contributed to the downfall of the Hanseatic League during the first half of the 15th century. Be it disease, misfortune, divine retribution or the Bullion Famine, our court lost its old splendor and its standing as a powerful mercantile union of hundreds of merchants across the germanic cities and beyond. In its stead, the scheming merchants of the Dutch court attempt to usurp our position and surpass us in terms of influence across the markets of Europe. Such behavior is no less the grounds for just wars and these petty men of Holland must be put in their place lest we risk inevitable demise."
 flavor_hsa.24.a: "We will have their heads for this!"
 
 flavor_hsa.25.t: "Hans Holbein the Younger"
 flavor_hsa.25.d: "It is truly a captivating view, to trace the ripples of important historical events such as the Renaissance. Hans Holbein is a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style becoming one of the most prominent figures of this style during the 16th century. Distinguished from his father, he initially worked in Basel, blending Late Gothic and Renaissance influences to create his unique aesthetic. After gaining recognition in England through his association with humanist figures like Thomas More, Holbein became the King's Painter to Henry VIII, producing remarkable portraits that captured both likeness and profound symbolism. His art, renowned for its precision and depth, continues to fascinate scholars and is considered a pinnacle of portraiture for its insightful depiction of character and elegant style."
 flavor_hsa.25.a: "The Northern Renaissance style flourishes because of great men such as him!"
 
 flavor_hsa.26.t: "The Crowning of a New Queen"
 flavor_hsa.26.d: "Many proclaimed our Republic to be on its dying breath as the second half of the 15th century saw our merchants struggling to maintain (and often losing) their monopoly across the many trade centers of Europe. Despite several setbacks and the machinations of our enemies, we have managed to not only come out on top but to also reinforce the values of our Trade League. Dominating in the most important markets from Norway to the Baltic we have proved our naysayers wrong, elevating the status of our great nation to never-before-seen heights! Truly this is the crowing of Germany's most powerful Queen! Long live the Hansa!"
 flavor_hsa.26.a: "We will embrace the future!"
 flavor_hsa.26.b: "Let us stick to our roots, instead."
